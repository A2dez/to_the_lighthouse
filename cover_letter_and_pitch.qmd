**Notes for pitch**

-   A search for meaning

-   The meaning of lifehouses

    -   I like to think of meaning as something that operates within a system. Addition and subtraction mean something within numerical systems. Wage-labour means something within modern life because cash is the bloodflow of so many things we need.

    -   I need to get out and if I don't, I start to crack up.

    -   Cycling gets me out but I need a destination, a reason to keep going and to push through the sheer boredom of

    -   I can't go to the gym. I can't cope with the misery of being in pain while seeing nothing new. Novelty keeps me fresh.

    -   The first time I went out cycling, I went to explore Tallaght and then I saw the mountains and decided I had to go there. The allure of the visible target.

    -   A lighthouse is the perfect destination, a target past which you cannot go.

    -   Yeah you have to get back but you'll always do that because you hafta.

        -   *the retreating seawater lures my space-craving soul into a crazed chase for freedom. I follow the coastal bike lane and feel the seabreeze on my face and my mind empties of thought for a moment or three.*

        -   *The sea takes you out of your world and without it, escaping is a lot harder. And I need to escape. If I cycle to a hundred-odd lighthouses, and write about them all, then I'll probably buy myself a year or two of good mental health. It doesn't even matter if anyone actually reads it.*

    -   words for immersion

    -   Rome Tour guide - vatican for pointing, forum for building up from scratch.

-   **Why**

    -   Something to write about that works for me

    -   Finding space for adventure within a busy life

        -   purpose, continuity of purpose

            -   format allows for this

        -   spontaneity

    -   Looking for a place to live

        -   town near the sea, good for kids, accessible to Dublin / home

        -   difficulty of buying a gaff

#### Length, scope, order

-   Project too big for one book

-   Dublin first then north then south-east/south

    -    Kind of doing it in a clockwise fashion
