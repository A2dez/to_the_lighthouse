**Notes for pitch**

-   A search for meaning

-   The meaning of lifehouses

    -   I like to think of meaning as something that operates within a system. Addition and subtraction mean something within numerical systems. Wage-labour means something within modern life because cash is the bloodflow of so many things we need.

    -   I need to get out and if I don't, I start to crack up.

    -   Cycling gets me out but I need a destination, a reason to keep going and to push through the sheer boredom of

    -   I can't go to the gym. I can't cope with the misery of being in pain while seeing nothing new. Novelty keeps me fresh.

    -   The first time I went out cycling, I went to explore Tallaght and then I saw the mountains and decided I had to go there. The allure of the visible target.

    -   A lighthouse is the perfect destination, a target past which you cannot go.

    -   Yeah you have to get back but you'll always do that because you hafta.

        -   *I decide to go directo(ish) to Fairview whence I can let the open air blow away the busyness of my midweek life and the clusterforked urbanscapes which host it*

        -   *the retreating seawater lures my space-craving soul into a crazed chase for freedom. I follow the coastal bike lane and feel the seabreeze on my face and my mind empties of thought for a moment or three.*

        -   *The sea takes you out of your world and without it, escaping is a lot harder. And I need to escape. If I cycle to a hundred-odd lighthouses, and write about them all, then I'll probably buy myself a year or two of good mental health. It doesn't even matter if anyone actually reads it.*

    -   Ireland is there. You can just go and see it, in your own good time
