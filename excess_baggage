The flip side is that it's harder to make ends meet because he works for himself.

Marketing

I grew up on the Bill Hicks school of marketing, where marketers and advertisers are advised to kill themselves, an 'authentic' but nihilistic viewpoint similar to the Punk attitude of never selling out. But it has made me afraid of my own shadow and unwilling to put myself out there.

It's nice to see this depth of attachment to a craft.

, but clearly the job is even more deeply ingrained in his head than, say, me being a writer, which I struggle to identify with because i don't get paid for it and I'm too ashamed to just go for it.

We end up having a bit of coda chat about waste water issues and the lack of new housing in the town and he mentions being town foreman during the late Celtic Tiger, presumably before the town fell complete apart and I'm guessing it was his retirement age.

Shame of even talking about boarding school, a so-called privilege that automatically disqualifies you from suffering pain, something I've experienced even within my own family.

It's probably a 3k walk along the rocky beach to Five Mile Point where there is a legit road back. ### Wicklow Coastline

The Wicklow Coastline is not a much-heralded place, unlike the mountains which retreat from it. The southern chunk is decent, The beaches are rocky and grind up against your feet whereas

Wicklow Bay is in the foreground from the harbour to Newcastle - they fucked the esate up here to keep the riffraff out of sight but the town has expanded - in the distance are Bray Head, the sugar loaf and other lesser known hills along which the mountain range - o and from there I can look out acroos most of East Wicklow, al I kick off the trip in Ocean View, an old council estate on the hill at the back of Wicklow Town

But not a lot happens along the Wicklow coastline either. The county covers a surprisingly short amount of latitude, being just 52k from the arse end of Arklow up to Little Bray on the Dublin border where the yin and the yang combine. That's only 4k longer than the span of County Dublin, thenceforth to Bremore Castle at the far end of Balbriggan, and 11k longer than the Wee county a little beyond. That explains why I reckon I can see, on a very clear day, the Carlingford Peninsula in Ireland's sunny north-east, just 112 flat-earth clicks away.

The good beaches begin south of Wicklow Head, a poor man's Howth Head, with cliff walks and a lighthouse that no one goes to cos the train service is so poor. But the northern half is notable only for is featureless, especially the 18k as the crow flies from Wicklow to Greystones.

The first part of the trip is to get to Bray which is easy on a bike, following the

Now I could take the so-called coast road from Wicklow-Rathnew to Newcastle but it is rather like the coast road running down most of Wexford, set back from the sea, and while it is a mellow to

The so-called coast road between Rathnew and Newcastle then on to Kilcoole is another one of those inland distributor roads with occasional laneways leading down to the sea. It's a nice quiet road to cycle but there ain't no seaside to be seen. But the coast itself is typically layered, with a long straight rocky beach and a single train line which connects Dublin to Rosslare.
