Interview with Jimmy McG ee

Dear Mr Murphy

I am writing to say thank you and well done on writing your excellent book which I have just monstered in the last few days. I too am a forty-one year old man with outstanding sporting ambitions and, about two-thirds of the way into the book I was ready to join the local GAA club in my new home, Wicklow Town, even though I have barely played five matches of the sport in my life and none on this island. Thankfully the last third put me off, although more due to demographics than concerns of putting an ageing body through the pain. I've just moved to Wicklow Town which, like Naas before it, is a one-club town with a ballooning population.

The one criticism I have of the book is that it is so well written and enjoyable. Nick Hornby has spoken about this issue. His gets his point or story across so well that people feel short-changed by the lack of effort they have to make. As soon as I heard the intro to your book on Audible, I knew that I was going to learn a lot about the social make-up of Ireland. My dad was a GAA man and I spent my childhood on Hill 16 but I ended up playing hashtag foreign sports so I never got connected to a club and have since felt like a bit of an outsider. Your book explained a lot about the association's inner workings in a way that I've never been able unravel.

Right now, I'm trying to rewrite the intro to my own book charting my own amateur sporting adventures - cycling to every lighthouse in Ireland. It's a work in progress and I've cycled to all thirty lighthouses along the Mild non-Atlantic way from East Cork to South County Down. I've got your voice in my head

Thanks to the structure of your book, I've decided to put my mam and dad front and centre in the intro. In this, I am following your approach because you have made me realise how lucky I am to have had such a lunatic set of parents who went cycling all over the world in their fifties and sixties. Obviously I've been steeped in that and I'm making my way around Ireland for now as I'm too busy for bigger adventures.

- Reminder of Black Tuesday in Maam's Cross and you appreciate the comforts of a house. Me and Jasper joined Leonard, Mary and Morto who were yomping across Ireland from Dzublin to Galway and on to Achill Island. We teamed up on the bleak side of Galway, setting of from an outhouse beyond Oughterard and decided to cut across country to Maam's Cross.

- It was June 2006 and it had been raining for two months. The first couple of miles were through a forest and it was mellow enough to play talking games, and then we hit open country, where the Western Way was marked with wooden pillars and a sign saying the Way was closed. Arrogantly, we marched on, and nine hours later we had covered the nine miles of rocky, wet, exposed terrain, and we sat in the boozer for tea. We still had to walk another thirteen miles on the road to Leenane, where Leonard and Mary treated themselves to a B&B while me, Jasper and Morto had to pitch a tent inside one of those green deserts made of conifer trees.

The blackcurrent bushes in our garden - and now my sister's too - derive from Coolmine estate, because before it was turned into two schools and a leisure centre in the late '70s, a fella he knew told him to come over and grab a few plants for himself.

and in fact my dad remembers when it was all just fields. He used to come here to assess x

as, when it was being sold to the presumably council in the 70s, someone told him to come over take the bushes.

which was, to be fair, tastefully turned into a leisure centre, two schools, and the Millenium Park, and ancient yew trees and giant sequoias

estates unless they are your own for there are no shops or facilities within them.

and my dad used to be out here assessing weeds among the crops and advising farmers on how to #spray them

- Backed up on the Strawberry beds

- People think that Blanch is near Lucan but it's actually 10k across a steep river valley

- Or else across the M50

Pay six nicker for the #privilege of dropping dinner over to my folks

The reason we've been living in Blanch, apart from housing-crisis desperation, is the fact that it's psychologically quite close to my family in Lucan, travelling between them is a joy because

The first part of the journey requires me to get to the Liffey from my gaff in Blanch, so I drop the same perpendicular as in the Poolbeg chapter, from the Snugborough Road Extension over the canal slash train bridge in Diswellstown, on the Blanch side of Clonsilla, and on to the Porterstown Road which skirts the top of the Liffey Valley.

One curiosity is that there have been roadworks here for like a decade, opposite the Maccie Ds ever since someone drove into the old demesne wall, and no one seems to want to take responsibility for fixing it. Perhaps the council are waiting until they own the land and can extend the demesne into the village and a path of interacting life can be restored to the river in parallel to the siloed dualler atop the esker above.

This time I turn right, after descending the freshy

It's the reason why Castleknock has maintained its high status

Yr.no says the wind is travelling at six or seven metres per second but that's a unit I haven't internalized at all so I need to convert it into kilometers or even miles per hour.

The 20kph wind is in my face on my way to Lucan, but I'm sheltered by the trees between the river and this blissful road.

. I start out the same as in the Poolbeg chapter, rolling down through Diswellstown and Rugged Lane to the Strawberry Beds, but turning right this time for Lucan village, not left to Chapelizod. Six Degrees Celsius is also not a fail. I've discovered that temperature in Fahrenheit matches exactly against University grades.

- Lucan village

Weir, near flooded

Fella there who says it burst a while back, up towards the apartments

We reminisce on the flood of I think 1992 when the Griffeen burst and flooded Kenneys and O'Neill's pubs. He was in there that morning and I ask him if he was still going or getting started and he says he was in for a cure

That day was one of the happiest memories of my childhood as me and my dad went for a walk together to scope out the other flood point, near the entrance to the Demesne, where the NAME RIVER converges with the Liffey.

In my memory, it was Saturday June 16, 1992, and Sports Day in school was cancelled, so we all came home from Boarding School for Half Term [it was actually 1993]. Me and Big Val brought a disposable camera, which was something you only did when you want on like holidays, and I remember being distraught when they didn't develop properly.

I point out that it's a pity this chunk of river is set off from the village but your man reminds that me the council has bought the land off the Italian Embo so we'll be able to walk through it and connect up with the Lucan demesne and on up to Leixlip. This, I point out, will be an important step towards putting in a #greenway all the way in to town, and my brother-in-law only suggest the other day that Shackleton's mills might be restored as a tourist spot, given how darn famous Ernest Shackleton is. Your man makes the point that there should be space enough for a big car park in the Embassy grounds and that will take a lot of the misery out of the village, which is beautiful but nothing like as well-used as it could be.

It's nice to talk Lucan for once.

I grew up on the Bill Hicks school of marketing, where marketers and advertisers are advised to kill themselves, an 'authentic' but nihilistic viewpoint similar to the Punk attitude of never selling out. But it has made me afraid of my own shadow and unwilling to put myself out there.

Wicklow Bay is in the foreground from the harbour to Newcastle - they fucked the esate up here to keep the riffraff out of sight but the town has expanded - in the distance are Bray Head, the sugar loaf and other lesser known hills along which the mountain range - o and from there I can look out acroos most of East Wicklow, al I kick off the trip in Ocean View, an old council estate on the hill at the back of Wicklow Town

with some of the best views

But not a lot happens along the Wicklow coastline either. The county covers a surprisingly short amount of latitude, being just 52k from the arse end of Arklow up to Little Bray on the Dublin border where the yin and the yang combine. That's only 4k longer than the span of County Dublin, thenceforth to Bremore Castle at the far end of Balbriggan, and 11k longer than the Wee county a little beyond. That explains why I reckon I can see, on a very clear day, the Carlingford Peninsula in Ireland's sunny north-east, just 112 flat-earth clicks away.

The good beaches begin south of Wicklow Head, a poor man's Howth Head, with cliff walks and a lighthouse that no one goes to cos the train service is so poor. But the northern half is notable only for is featureless, especially the 18k as the crow flies from Wicklow to Greystones.

The so-called coast road between Rathnew and Newcastle then on to Kilcoole is another one of those inland distributor roads with occasional laneways leading down to the sea. It's a nice quiet road to cycle but there ain't no seaside to be seen. But the coast itself is typically layered, with a long straight rocky beach and a single train line which connects Dublin to Rosslare.


Outtakes

It's lashing ninety outside and I'm praying it'll ease up soon so I can get a dry few hours before it pisses again around lunchtime. Yesterday was a day for the bike and the camera but Leinster were busy losing their third European Cup Final in a row, this time agin Toulouse, and I wasn't going to miss that for the world. I watched it with my folks, the two of them trembling like never before in their one hundred and seventy (plus) aggregated years, as the tense game moved into extra-time, after Ciaran Frawley missed a winning dropgoal by a cunthair, in a repeat of the 2014 semi-final, while a fella my size, the name of Antoine Dupont, repeatedly thwarted the Blue Magic.

Years ago, Scrimogen Payphone told me that the reason why Bray is so shite is because the town centre is too far from the strand. Then, having learnt their lesson, the Victorians put Brighton's centre right beside the sea. True or not. I always liked the theory because it fits in well with the long-standing view that Bray - aka Breirut - is a BradSwiss. Despite that annoying energy lull between the main street and the sea, there is good synergy between the geograoh

In recent years, Bray has become as fashionable as its beauty warrants and the town has enough internal momentum to keep one's energy afloat.

Deleted Scenes

I sit down on a boulder and take some videos to talk about what's been going on so far today but I'm not happy with the format. There is an underdeveloped version of me that takes videos of places and uploads them to YouTube but the format I like - commentating on people - seldom works in the remote places I cycle to. I feellike more needs to be happening otherwise I just fill the gap with slightly rushed chat. Maybe I just need to practice and leave in some long Dan Carlin-y pauses while I gather thoughts.

Sharlene and Rhasidat running for more medals tonight. Ciara Mageean having slowly ascended to a championship gold. The accents are a whistlestop tour of the island. Rhasidat, from somewhere in Tallaght, has a new mix of Old Dublin, where every second word ends in a [h], and that aspirational Gen Zeeer intonation you hear when they drink with relish their fifteen-euro cocktails. I just want to inspire the next generation just like others inspired me. If you can't see it, you can't be it. I can't hear any of the grumpy Brochat I used to hear every day among the black teenagers in Blanch libro, where African influences have blended into West Dublin's as-yet coagulating accents, leaving space for a distinct social identity to be expressed. Although maybe it just fades away after school when your localized curiosities get diluted out by the big bad wuddled.

Gueegle Mops does its best to send me out that way, needlessly diverting me off the N25 due to its distaste for cyclists on main roads. Yet it keeps calling it the the 'Three N25', a strange moniker that is only explained when the signposts suggest I am on Euro Velo Route 3, The Pilgrim's Path (although I am yet to find a map of this).

The structure is deloosh allthesame and was part of that wave of great lighthouses designed by George Halpin in the 1810s.


### Cork

Niki Segnit's

It was lovely last night to do a visual recap of so many places I've been to along the southern coast. Waterford. Dungarvan. Youghal. Each trip is so vivid in my memory, between actually being there and then the long, slow, grinding mastication of that memory into readable words. The process also deletes some details and the drive has reconnected some dots. The sun was setting slowly in front of me along the N25 and a crescent moon popped up beside it. I have a sense of finality too, and symmetry, finishing up this book in Cork, the wetter, mellower little sibling city to Dublin where it all began.

It's been a long time since I saw so many people wearing such new clothes.

I haven't seen this in a long time, well-dressed people.

We're well used in modern Ireland to people of every colour and creee - except for Real Life Black Americans who do remain a novelty. What strikes me is that so many of these people are wearing new clothes or at least they haven't been through fifty cycles in the Rogan Josh. Light reflects evenely off their Tommy Hilfiger shirts

Cobh seems to be a cruise ship with a town attached.

I get off the ferry, turn right, and pass out a family of camper cyclists, #welljeal, which is my dream holiday.

Suddenly Cobh appears on my right, in the actual awter, a floating town, sidegridded with a thousand mini balconies, a handful of lifeboats, and a bunch of weird boat stuff on the roof.

I descend down the hill and find a permatown attached to the cruise ship, and a glut of boozers, restaurans and tat floggers sucking lifeblood cash from these proverbial fish out of actual water.

Across the water, is the Soviet Republic of East Cork, with Whitegate Power Station looking particularly well from this distance with its single red&white hooped tower. Further out is Roches Point and a narrow channel through which giant boats ease through, including the Titanic on its last stop.

Wikipedia summarises the geography better than I can:

The city centre is an island between two channels of the River Lee which meet downstream at its eastern end, where the quays and docks along the river lead outwards towards Lough Mahon and Cork Harbour, one of the largest natural harbours in the world."

The bike lane brings me out towards the Mardyke, although I nearly get doored by a driver getting out of his car but I swerve in time. I don't blame him for not looking, I blame whoever designs and permits a column of parked cars between a road and a bike lane, because motorists understandably let their guard down on the non-road side. After the skinny metal bridge the bike lane follows the river

The city is an island on a split river but its geography is burnt into my head as a series of short, curved moves, mostly over bridges between seemingly disconnected places.

The city centre is an island on a split river which then explodes out into an enormous inland body of water, with islands and peninsulae and ports and boats.

I can see the river on the near side by not the far side. All that stands out are sundry large buildings, mostly along the river, and a large expanse of low-rise buildings, with a chain of shallow hills in the background .

I also have no clue how nice the surroundings of the city are as I've only ever been to the centre, cricketing as a teenager, on the piss in my twenties, and getting my brain tested for my light sensitivity condition when I was turned thirty and finally sorting out my life.

 coast-to-coast trips was getting there and back. She's cycled Mizen to Malin, Land's End to John O'Groats, the length of Vietnam, the diagonal width of America, from San Fran to Maine, and, with my aulfla as far as Melbourne, Perth to Sydney. And the biggest difficulty, in her memory at least, was getting to the start and back from the endpoint. 

In the end I agree that I'd just drive to Kinvarra, start there with the sunlight, cycle 30k out to Black Head, double back and then drive backto the hotel for 1pm. But it feels wrong cos I kinda want to cycle the whole of the Irish coast and I'd be left with another missing 25k. As it happens, I wake up at 4am and I can't help myself. 

Suddenly I have the chance to do the full trip, as long as I brave the dark.

Complex Route

Cork City and harbour. It's watery and complex.

Cork Harbour is among a handful claiming to be the second largest natural harbour in the world, with Port Jackson in Sydney being the undisputed champion. 

But first off, I want to understand the topography of the city centre, with its split river, endless bridges and impossibly steep streets on one side. I've been to Cork City a handful of times in my life, cricketing as a teenager, drinking in my twenties at the Jazz(less) Festival, and a couple of later trips to get my eyes and brain tested for my light sensitivity condition. But I always seem to be crossing bridges and getting out of my geographic depth. Back in the Daniel Doris, before your Google Maps, I would just hit a boozer with my head down, or follow a local's outstretched arm, and the geography never got burnt into my brain. 

I'm starting to get a sense of what is going on and, after yet another detour up to Montenotte House, I finally have my route planned out. 

My plan is to follow the river and soak up the soothing green walkways around the Mardyke and UCC, and then I can loop back into or around the city and out the docks towards Blackrock Castle. They do guided tours every hour and it'd ruin the day to have to rush back to catch one in the late afternoon. From there I'll head for Passage West to catch the Lee Scratch over to Cobh and thence I'll either do a tour of Great Island and back via Fota Island, or else just double back and maybe check out out the south-west of the harbour, Ringaskiddy and Crosshaven. It's nice to have options for a change.

The distances are short so I can faff about and explore, but my main goal is to understand the watery complexity of the city and harbour, an enormous inland body of water, broken up by islands, passages and peninsulae, and peppered with ports of every kind.

The enormous lower harbour is shaped like an inverted conical flask, an upside-down triangle of water which gets squeezed through a wide passage out into the Celtic Sea slash Atlantic Ocean.

I'm heading out to see a ugly, spidery light on the water in Cobh, a lighthouse in name only, and, either before or after, I'll go for a tour of Blackrock Castle near Cork City.

 It used to function as a lighthouse and is now an astronomical observatory, of all things. 

Now, having said that, today's journey will be among inland seas and from every point there will be land visible beyond the water. 

Cork Harbour is among a handful claiming to be the second largest natural harbour in the world, with Port Jackson in Sydney being the undisputed champion. I got a sense of the harbour's magnitude from its East side, on my way to Roche's Point Lighthouse, where the land is simple and contiguous. But here on the west side, it's a complex mix of land and rivers, islands and loughs. Several rivers feed into it and wrap around the islands, including one hosting Cork city centre and a Great Island containing the Cove of Cork, once called Queenstown, but nowadays spelt <C-O-B-H> in self-determining Gaelic. Great Island separates the sizeable Upper Harbour from the enormous Lower Harbour, with its island prisons and toxic dumps and relatively narrow passage out to the Celtic Sea slash wild Atlantic Ocean. I'm going to wind my way round out the riverscape of Cork City then mosey out to the spidery lighthouse in Cobh. En route I'll stop off at the astronomical observatory in Blackrock Castle, a former lighthouse located where the wide River Lee meets the yuge Lough Mahon.

I got a sense of the harbour's size from the East side, on my way to Roche's Point Lighthouse, where the land is simple and contiguous. But here on the west side of the harbour, a lot more is going on. In the northwest, the city centre sits on an island, shaped like a dog's skull, around which the River Lee splits into two channels. These recombine, widen and open up into Lough Mahon. This inland body of water is known as the Upper Harbour, and it gets squeezed through a narrow passage, before opening out at The Cove of Cork, spelt < C-O-B-H > since Ireland got its independence. The enormous lower harbour is shaped like an inverted conical flask, an upside-down triangle of water which gets squeezed through a wide passage out into the Celtic Sea slash Atlantic Ocean. It's an unusually complex mix of land and sea and I'm assuming it's going to merit a lot of examination.
