As I write this, my fortieth birthday is fast approaching and, as I think about it, this book may well be my mid-life crisis. I've wanted to be a writer since I was a teenager but I've struggled for a format, and I stumbled across this one by accident. I've always had lots of thoughts when I cycle and often I write them down but I've never had a cohesive project to pull it all together until I thought of cycling to every lighthouse in Ireland. I didn't begin with a particular fondness for lighthouses except that they are target points in beautiful places and I need a sense of purpose to get me up and out. I could bang on here about my failed projects as a writer or about my influences and my inspiration and blah blah blah, but all that shite comes out during the book which has turned into something of a reflection upon who I am and where my life is and has been going.

But I do need to say how much of an influence my parents have been on my love of cycling. They used to go off on cycling holidays together, first around Europe and once the whole way across Australia in 1997, when my dad was already over sixty. His back got injured but my mam kept going and went coast-to-coast across America in 1999, and many smaller trips after. I didn't get into cycling until I was thirty, and in 2014, me and my mam cycled from Mizen Head to Malin Head, the length of Ireland, with my dad in the car as back up. The biggest inspiration was that they managed to find the time and energy to do see the world, despite having six kids, jobs, and supposedly ageing bodies.

I plan to write this book chapter by chapter, cycling to a lighthouse and adding to it slowly. I don't know or frankly care how long it will take. I write via quarto documents, a type of markdown document used primarily by coders in the R language, and [the 'code' is stored on Github](https://github.com/A2dez/to_the_lighthouse), which is used for version control, so that you can both edit and keep your work, and not rely on documents labeled as like "Book_Final (7) version 2_7th Oct 1997.doc"

As I write this, I've picked off all of the lighthouses around Dublin and Wicklow, and there's a couple more I can get to as day trips along the Mild non-Atlantic Way. Rosslare and Carlingford, for example. But once it comes to the big long looparooney running clockwise from Waterford to Down, I'll have to do it in spurts, mixing lighthousery with little family holidays, and maybe bring in various friends along the way. I'd also love to bring my dad in a carrier bike, and maybe my mam can cycle a bit too if she's still able, and my wife and my bike-loving son too, and we can throw the baby on the back for a few legs while we're at it.
