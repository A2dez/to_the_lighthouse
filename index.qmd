This is a book about finding little adventures in a life too busy for big adventures. I have a wife, young kids, elderly parents, a sapping job, and an intermittent urge to escape. I used to stall off on my Tobler and clear my head by cycling to the sea or up the mountains. When I cycle, I start writing sentences in my head, like a poor man's Wordsworth, peddling and punning in tandem. Then I'd lash down notes over coffee and have the outline for a piece I'd never publish. One day, recorded in the first chapter of this book, I realised that I could bottle my behaviour by cycling to all of the lighthouses in Ireland and writing about it. I didn't have to head off on one big journey and write it up after like normal travel writer. Instead, I could stall off on a set of day trips then I write a blog *and* a book at the same time. In the end I bottled the blog but I did dunzo the thankfully book.

### The carrot and the shtick

The pictures in this book are of lighthouse but the writing mostly isn't. Others revel in and write about engineering and shipwrecks and the loneliness of the lighthouse keeper, and I will sometimes refer you to these writings along the way. Instead, the book is about my journeys. Cycling *to* the lighthouse. Getting out the door, hitting the road, seeing places, listening to people and cyclobathing in the beauty of the Irish coast. Eventually, an hour or twelve later, a lighthouse always appears at the end of the tunnel. I still struggle to express their allure. They provide the perfect carrot on a stick, pretty little targets to aim for, surrounded by the emptiness of the big blue wobbly sea. Like flags on The Moon that you can actually go and see yourself. That visual target makes it easier to ploddy peddle forward through tiredness or boredom or manky weather. Afterwards, writing each chapter in turn would give a daily purpose to my life. I'd write in the early morning, playing with words before the world called for my attention. And thus I kept myself sane amidst the swirling drain of midlife.

### Home and Away

This volume covers the thirty-odd lighthouses of Ireland's #AncientEast and it doubles up as a loose effort to see the entire coastline along the mild, non-Atlantic Way stretching from East Cork up to South County Down. Other volumes will cover the big long looparooney round the Wild Atlantic Doris, boat trips out to the islands, and a trip around Northern dauntingly Ireland, but I haven't yet worked out a format for them as I feel I have exhausted the current format.

The first few chapters take place at home in County Dublin whose complex coastline is full of lighthouses. These chapters deal with memory and mental health, as the familiar places remind me of who I am and where I've come from. I come to learn why I am doing this journey, how the bike and the sea wash away the strains of my life. The terrain becomes progressively less familiar as the book progresses, with the journeys to Wicklow Town and Balbriggan being a transition from home to away. The trips down memory lane are replaced by the reflections of a fresh tourist. Ireland is a land of roads, hedges, farms, hills, cliffs, bays, beaches and peninsulae. I cover the coast of Meath, Louth and South Down, before taking on Wexford, Waterford, North Wicklow and East Cork, semi-systematically. The journeys also double up as a househunting venture, looking for a place by the sea to raise our family, in the hope that we can break free from our shitbox duplex on the outskirts of Dublin's Fair City.

### **Mam and Dad**

When my mother ran her first Dublin City Marathon in 1982, aged forty, she had five daughters cheering her on and me in her unwittingly belly. The natural transition was to upgrade to triathlons as she had grown up swimming in the sea and cycling into work. Every summer we'd holiday in Sligo where she'd do a half-ironman. She began cycling across Europe with her late friend, Ann Behan. My dad started cycling with her of a Sunday morning and soon they cycled along the Danube to celebrate their twenty-fifth wedding anniversary, and the next year they cycled from Paris to Lourdes and back. In 1997, they cycled across Australia, from Perth to Sydney, with the late Liz McKenna and Vincent Crowley. My dad's injuries slowed him down but my mam cycled 6000k across America in 1999 and then the length of Vietnam. Me and my sisters would track their journeys on a wallchart, and then soak up their stories when they finally came home, bearing weightless postcards from strange lands. Their memories of these trips are stronger than anything else they've done in life. My dad still loves to talk about cycling up the Col du Tourmalet and my mam can still feel the highs of cycling over the Rockies and the lows along on the dull plains out the other side. In 2014, once I finally discovered cycling myself, my mam and I cycled Mizen to Malin together with my dad in the car behind slash ahead. After that trip, her mental health deteriorated and the medication has stolen her magical energy. I still hope to help her write the story of her fabulous life as a rambling mammy, back when it was neither profitable nor popular. This book is for Mary, for having the courage to do what she wanted to do, and for Valentine, for having the serenity to accept and enjoy the wife that no man could change.
