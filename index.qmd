![*Fifteen minute's cycle from Dublin City Centre is a path to took me fifteen minutes to cycle here from Dublin city centre, yet Poolbeg peninsula is so abandoned that I bumped into a bunch of ravers making their way home from a sesh on the beach.* ](images/sunrise_poolbeg_2023-02-05%20at%2010.54.23.jpeg)

As I write this, my fortieth birthday is fast approaching and, as I think about it, this book may well be my mid-life crisis, pondering my life while prancing around in lycra. I've wanted to be a writer since I was a teenager but I've struggled for a format and a topic until this one coalesced and I decided just go for it. Cycling new places always triggers new thoughts and, as I ploddy ploddy forward, I start writing them down in my head. Later, when I stop for coffee, I can just log them on my till receipt, and wham bam, thank you ma'am, I've got my outline. I've done this for years and I write some of them in my diaries or as blog posts, but blogs are an incoherent mess with no internal momentum, so no books have ever presented themselves. Then one day I realised that I could write them all up using *bookdown* or *quarto*, formats often used for writing the computer code textbooks I'm constantly reading in work. This way, I could publish the book as I go along, chapter by chapter, and not have to suffer from the horrible problem of carrying around a bunch of unfinished, unpublished projects. As you read this, the book is most likely unfinished, yet it exists, and I am under no pressure to rush through it.

Once I had a format, then several projects came to me, including this one of cycling to every lighthouse in Ireland, although the rest will be full of pretty data visualizations rather than landscapes. I didn't begin with a lifelong passion for lighthouses. I just needed a target to get me up and out of the house and to see the extraordinary beauty of the Irish landscape. But the more I look at lighthouses, the more I understand their symbolic beauty too, like flags on the moon, marking territory.

I must

y biggest influence has been Hadley Wickham, a prominent an inspirational data scientist, who says he writes for an hour every morning. So I try and write a bit before my son gets up for breakfast and then I start my job job after I drop him off to school.

I've always had lots of thoughts when I cycle and often I write them down but I've never had a cohesive project to pull it all together until I thought of cycling to every lighthouse in Ireland. I didn't begin with a particular fondness for lighthouses except that they are target points in beautiful places and I need a sense of purpose to get me up and out. I could bang on here about my failed projects as a writer or about my influences and my inspiration and blah blah blah, but all that shite comes out during the book which has turned into something of a reflection upon who I am and where my life is and has been going.

But I do need to say how much of an influence my parents have been on my love of cycling. They used to go off on cycling holidays together, first around Europe and once the whole way across Australia in 1997, when my dad was already over sixty. His back got injured but my mam kept going and went coast-to-coast across America in 1999, and many smaller trips after. I didn't get into cycling until I was thirty, and in 2014, me and my mam cycled from Mizen Head to Malin Head, the length of Ireland, with my dad in the car as back up. The biggest inspiration was that they managed to find the time and energy to do see the world, despite having six kids, jobs, and supposedly ageing bodies.

I plan to write this book chapter by chapter, cycling to a lighthouse and adding to it slowly. I don't know or frankly care how long it will take. I write via quarto documents, a type of markdown document used primarily by coders in the R language, and [the 'code' is stored on Github](https://github.com/A2dez/to_the_lighthouse), which is used for version control, so that you can both edit and keep your work, and not rely on documents labeled as like "Book_Final (7) version 2_7th Oct 1997.doc"

As I write this, I've picked off all of the lighthouses around Dublin and Wicklow, and there's a couple more I can get to as day trips along the Mild non-Atlantic Way. Rosslare and Carlingford, for example. But once it comes to the big long looparooney running clockwise from Waterford to Down, I'll have to do it in spurts, mixing lighthousery with little family holidays, and maybe bring in various friends along the way. I'd also love to bring my dad in a carrier bike, and maybe my mam can cycle a bit too if she's still able, and my wife and my bike-loving son too, and we can throw the baby on the back for a few legs while we're at it.
