As I write this, my fortieth birthday is fast approaching and, as I think about it, this book may well be my mid-life crisis, pondering my life while prancing around in lycra. I've wanted to be a writer since I was a teenager but I've struggled for a format and a topic until this idea coalesced and I decided just go for it. Cycling new places always triggers new thoughts and, as I ploddy ploddy forward, I start writing them down in my head. Later, when I stop for coffee, I can just log them on my till receipt, and wham bam, thank you ma'am, I've got my outline. I've done this for years and I write some of them in my diaries or as blog posts, but blogs are an incoherent mess with no internal momentum, so no books have ever presented themselves. Then one day I realised that I could write them all up using *bookdown* or *quarto*, formats often used for writing the computer code textbooks I'm constantly reading in work. This way, I could publish the book as I go along, chapter by chapter, writing a wee bit every morning before the kids wake up, and I wouldn't have to suffer from the horrible problem of carrying around a bunch of unfinished, unpublished projects. As you read this, the book is most likely unfinished, yet it exists, and I am under no pressure to rush through it. [The 'code' is stored on Github](https://github.com/A2dez/to_the_lighthouse), which is used for version control, so that you can both edit and keep your work, and not rely on documents labeled like "Book_Final (7) version 2_7th Oct 1997.doc"

I didn't begin with a lifelong passion for lighthouses. I just needed a target to get me up and out of the house and to revel the beauty of the Irish landscape. But the more I look at lighthouses, the more I understand their symbolic beauty too, like flags on the moon, marking territory. The bigger influence has been my parents who used to go off on cycling holidays together, first around Europe and once the whole way across Australia in 1997. They were no longer young on these trips but their example showed me a different way to age, unlike other parents, as they went off and explored the earth. My dad's back got injured but my mam kept going and went coast-to-coast across America in 1999, and many smaller trips after. I didn't get into cycling until I was thirty, and in 2014, me and my mam cycled from Mizen Head to Malin Head, the length of Ireland, with my dad in the car as back up.

As I write this, I've picked off all of the lighthouses around Dublin and Wicklow, and there's a couple more I can get to as day trips along the Mild non-Atlantic Way. Rosslare and Carlingford, for example. But once it comes to the big long looparooney running clockwise from County Waterford to County Down, I'll have to do it in spurts, mixing lighthousery with little family holidays, and maybe bring in various friends along the way. I'd also love to bring my dad in a carrier bike, and maybe my mam can cycle a bit too if she's still able. My wife will join and our bike-loving son too, and maybe we can throw the baby on the back for a few legs once she's big enough.

*And I don't see any point me writing a summary of stuff we can both read on the Jimmy Internet.*
