This is not a book about lighthouses. It is a book about cycling *to* the lighthouses dotted around Ireland, one day trip at a time. Getting ready, hitting the road, seeing places, listening to people and cyclobathing in the beauty of the Irish coast. Eventually, an hour or twelve later, a lighthouse always appears at the end of the tunnel. This volume covers the thirty-odd lighthouses of Ireland's #AncientEast and it doubles up as a loose effort to see the entire coastline along the mild, non-Atlantic Way stretching from East Cork up to South County Down. Other volumes will cover the big long looparooney round the Wild Atlantic Doris, boat trips out to the islands, and a trip around Northern dauntingly Ireland, but I haven't yet worked out a format for them.

### Carrot Towers

This volume is a book is about finding little adventures in a life too busy for big adventures. I have a wife, young kids, elderly parents, a sapping job, and an intermittent urge to escape. I used to cycle to the sea or up the mountains and maybe lash down a few notes afterwards, but it was always haphazard and hard to motivate myself to go far. One day, recorded in the first chapter of this book, I realised that I could bottle my behaviour by cycling to all of the lighthouses in Ireland and writing about it.

I had no prior interest in lighthouses, nor did I know there was a growing public interest in them. Lighthouses simply provided me with the perfect carrot on a stick, pretty little targets to keep my legs peddling in face of tiredness and Irish weather. Meanwhile, cycling to new places always triggers fresh thoughts and, as I ploddy ploddy forward, I start writing them down in my head, noodling and peddling in tandem. Then I'd stop for coffee, lash down my notes and, whambam, I've got my outline. Afterwards, I could write the rest from the comfort of home, playing with words in the early morning before anyone needed me. And thus I kept myself sane amidst the swirling drain of midlife.

### Home and Away

This book begins at home along the lighthouse heavy coast of Dublin. These chapters deal with memory and mental health, as the familiar places remind me of who I am and where I've come from. I come to learn why I am doing this journey, how the bike and the sea wash away the strains of my life. The terrain becomes progressively less familiar as the book progresses, with the Wicklow Town and Balbriggan chapters being a transition from home to away, and the trips down memory lane are replaced by the reflections of a fresh tourist. I cover the coast of Meath, Louth and South Down, before taking on Wexford, Waterford, North Wicklow and East Cork. This is a land of roads, hedges, farms, hills, cliffs, beaches and little peninsulae. The journeys also double up as a househunting venture, exploring the Leinster coast for a place to raise our family, in the hope that we can break free from our shitbox duplex on the outskirts of Dublin's Fair City.

### **Guiding Lights**

When my mother ran her first Dublin City Marathon in 1982, aged forty, she had five daughters cheering her on and me in her unwittingly belly. Upgrading to triathlons was an easy transition as she had grown up swimming in the sea and cycling into town. Every summer we'd holiday in Sligo where she'd do a half-ironman and she began cycling around Europe with her late friend, Ann Behan. My dad started cycling with her of a Sunday morning and soon they cycled along the Danube together and from Paris to Lourdes and back. In 1997, they cycled across Australia, from Perth to Sydney, with the late Liz McKenna and Vincent Crowley. My dad's injuries slowed him down but my mam cycled 6000k across America in 1999 and the length of Vietnam later. Me and my sisters would track their journeys on a map, and then soak up their stories when they finally came home, bearing weightless postcards from strange lands. Their memories of these trips are stronger than anything they've ever done. My dad still loves to talk about cycling up the Col du Tourmalet and my mam can feels the highs of cycling over The Rockies and the lows she felt on the dull plains out the other side. I want to write a book about her life as a rambling mammy back when it was neither profitable nor popular.
