When my mam ran her first Dublin City Marathon in 1982, aged forty, she had five daughters cheering her on and me in her unwittingly belly. Running was sweeping the nation and it was a natural transition for someone whose body was conditioned by a life of swimming and cycling. She grew up in Clontarf along Dublin Bay and lived by the tide. Every day she'd go for a swim in the Bull Wall and then, as a teenager in the late '50s, she got a bike and cycled in and out of town to work. These years of good clean fun ended abruptly when she got married in 1966 and moved inland to rural Lucan where my dad had been working. The catalyst was dancing, a hugely popular activity whose social function was to reel in young people and churn out mammies and daddies. They bought a #NewBuild in a lonesome estate whose only facility was a road down the middle and a growing slew of sprogs to play on it. Within six years, my parents had contributed four girls to the local pot and home life was filled with washable nappies, burnt liver and Childcraft books. My dad worked nearby in an agricultural co-op, a solid job for the Nth son of a farmer and came home for his lunch. His vegetable plot in the huge garden fed the family. To my sisters' scarlification, my mam sometimes fed them nettle soup and she didn't believe in TV.

Reuseable nappies, burnt liver and Childcraft books. To my sisters' scarlification, my mam didn't believe in TV. My dad worked nearby in an agricultural co-op, a solid job for the Nth son of a farmer, and my mam taught music when she wasn't looking after the kids, and on a Sunday she played the church organ with my sisters in her choir. In the summer, she'd load the kids in the car and head off to Dublin's beaches whenever she could. She never got over living far from the sea. After twelve years, my mam did a music diploma in UCD and cycled there and back. This was a newfound freedom for her. 50k on the bike a few times a week. Nowadays your colleagues might marvel at that behaviour but back then people thought she was a loon. Someone once pulled up beside her and asked if she wanted a lift to the mental hospital, although she managed to avoid the place until 2014. She graduated in 1979 and celebrated by having another girl, Margaret, and then I slotted in as the younger partner in the second iteration of the family. Mam is not someone who could sit at home all day, so she outsourced her parenting to my elder sisters, especially Barbara, and just began galavanting goodo.

Interview with Jimmy McG ee

With a marathon in the bank, the natural transition was to do triathlons and I went all over the country for these with Maggs and my dad. Every summer we'd holiday in Sligo where mam would do a half-ironman. She began cycling across Europe with her late friend, Ann Behan, and by 1989 dad jumped on the bantwagon and started cycling with her of a Sunday morning â€“ thanks to the introduction of a cheeky Saturday evening mass. In 1991 they cycled along the Danube to celebrate their twenty-fifth wedding anniversary and suddenly every year had a spin thrown in. Paris to Lourdes and back. Up and down Sweden. In '95, mam and Liz McKenna, her spiritual twin, cycled from Lands End to John O'Groats, a format she loved. Coast to coast. In '97 they all cycled all the way across Australia, from Perth to Sydney, with the late Vincent Crowley and, in the van, Tony Rock, a triathlon friend and brother of Barney. My dad had to peel off at Melbourne to come home and look after the shop he had since set up after his job went tits up in '84. For six weeks, a seventeen-year-old Margaret had been running the shop while I, now fourteen, helped out and then went home to cook dinner every evening, blasting out tunes in our seemingly permanent free faff. Barbara, who now had two toddlers of her own,,lived nearby and kept an eye on us. Dad got injured then so in 1999, my mam joined a posse of Yanks and cycled across America from San Fran to Maine on a 6000k diagonal across all kinds of climates.

Me and my sisters would track their journeys on a wallchart, and Emer even set up a blog on the old interweb 1.0. We'd soak up their stories when they finally came home, bearing weightless postcards from strange lands. Their memories of these trips are stronger than anything else they've done in life. My dad still loves to talk about cycling up the Col du Tourmalet and my mam can still feel the highs of cycling over the Rockies and the lows along on the dull plains out the other side. In 2014, once I had finally discovered cycling myself, me and mam cycled together from Mizen Head to Malin Head with my dad in the car behind slash ahead. After that trip, her mental health deteriorated and she had an exceptionally serious bout of mania. The doctors couldn't believe how quickly she recovered but Covid lockdowns struck her hard and the medication has stolen some of her magical energy. She still swam in the sea until she was eighty, when she finally felt its cold, so now she gets the Boola Bus into town and does lengths in the Townsend Street pool. This book is for Mary, for having the courage to do what she wanted to do, and for Valentine, for having the serenity to accept and enjoy the wife that no man could change.

When I started this book, I was thirty-nine and my wife was pregnant with our second child.

**THIS BOOK**

This is a book about finding lots of little adventures in a life too busy for big adventures. I have a wife, young children, elderly parents, a sapping job, and an intermittent urge to escape from all of them.

I was in the habit of nipping off early on a weekend mrn

At the weekends, I got into the habit of slipping out early in the morning and I'd be up at the sea or up the Dublin mountains by 9 in the Yat.

I used to stall off on my Tobler and clear my head by cycling to the sea or up the mountains. When I cycle, I start writing sentences in my head, like a poor man's Wordsworth, peddling and punning in tandem. Then I'd lash down notes over coffee and have the outline for a piece I'd never publish. One day, recorded in the first chapter of this book, I realised that I could bottle my behaviour by cycling to all of the lighthouses in Ireland and writing about the it. I didn't have to head off on one big journey and write it up after like normal travel writer. Instead, I could stall off on a set of day trips then I write a blog *and* a book at the same time. In the end I bottled the blog but I did dunzo the thankfully book.

### The carrots and the shtick

The pictures in this book are of lighthouse but the writing mostly isn't. Others revel in and write about engineering and shipwrecks and the loneliness of the lighthouse keeper, and I will sometimes refer you to these writings along the way. Instead, the book is about my journeys. Cycling *to* the lighthouse. Getting ready, hitting the road, seeing places, listening to people and cyclobathing in the beauty of the Irish coast. Eventually, an hour or twelve later, a lighthouse always appears at the end of the tunnel. They provide the perfect carrot on a stick, pretty little targets to aim for, surrounded by the emptiness of the big blue wobbly sea. Like flags on The Moon that you can actually go and see yourself. That visual target makes it easier to ploddy peddle forward despite tiredness or boredom or manky weather. Afterwards, writing each chapter in turn gave purpose to my life. I'd write in the early morning, playing with words before the world called for my attention. And thus I kept myself sane for two years amidst the swirling drain of midlife.

### Home and Away

This volume covers the thirty-odd lighthouses of Ireland's #AncientEast and it doubles up as a loose effort to see the entire coastline along the mild, non-Atlantic Way stretching from East Cork up to South County Down. Other volumes will cover the big long looparooney round the Wild Atlantic Doris, boat trips out to the island lights, and a trip around Northern dauntingly Ireland, but I haven't yet worked out a format for them.

The first few chapters take place at home in County Dublin whose vaired coastline is full of lighthouses. These chapters deal with memory and mental health, as the familiar places remind me of who I am and where I've come from. I come to learn why I am doing this journey, how the bike and the sea wash away the strains of my life. The terrain becomes progressively less familiar as the book progresses, with the journeys to Wicklow Town and Balbriggan being a transition from home to away. The trips down memory lane are replaced by the reflections of a fresh tourist. Ireland is a land of roads, hedges, farms, hills, cliffs, bays, beaches and peninsulae. I cover the coast of Meath, Louth and South Down, before taking on Wexford, Waterford, North Wicklow and East Cork, semi-systematically. The journeys also double up as a househunting venture, looking for a place by the sea to raise our family, in the hope that we can break free from our shitbox duplex on the outskirts of Dublin's Fair City.

Dear Mr Murphy

I am writing to say thank you and well done on writing your excellent book which I have just monstered in the last few days. I too am a forty-one year old man with outstanding sporting ambitions and, about two-thirds of the way into the book I was ready to join the local GAA club in my new home, Wicklow Town, even though I have barely played five matches of the sport in my life and none on this island. Thankfully the last third put me off, although more due to demographics than concerns of putting an ageing body through the pain. I've just moved to Wicklow Town which, like Naas before it, is a one-club town with a ballooning population.

The one criticism I have of the book is that it is so well written and enjoyable. Nick Hornby has spoken about this issue. His gets his point or story across so well that people feel short-changed by the lack of effort they have to make. As soon as I heard the intro to your book on Audible, I knew that I was going to learn a lot about the social make-up of Ireland. My dad was a GAA man and I spent my childhood on Hill 16 but I ended up playing hashtag foreign sports so I never got connected to a club and have since felt like a bit of an outsider. Your book explained a lot about the association's inner workings in a way that I've never been able unravel.

Right now, I'm trying to rewrite the intro to my own book charting my own amateur sporting adventures - cycling to every lighthouse in Ireland. It's a work in progress and I've cycled to all thirty lighthouses along the Mild non-Atlantic way from East Cork to South County Down. I've got your voice in my head

Thanks to the structure of your book, I've decided to put my mam and dad front and centre in the intro. In this, I am following your approach because you have made me realise how lucky I am to have had such a lunatic set of parents who went cycling all over the world in their fifties and sixties. Obviously I've been steeped in that and I'm making my way around Ireland for now as I'm too busy for bigger adventures.

well done
