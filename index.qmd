0735 Saturday, October 22, 2022

It's starting to get bright outside and I can feel the bike calling me but I don't want to wake up the chunfla and force my pregnant missus to wake up too, so I lash on a shitty coat and head out in my leisure pants aka pajamas instead of going upstairs to dig out the lycra. I'm only cycling Yvonne so it doesn't matter if I look like I'm nipping out for a baguette. I grab a spare t-shirt and use it as a scarf and then I can change later when I stop for coffee and the sweat turns cold. There's a high-viz jacket floating around too so I'm good to go although I don't know where yet. I"m not in the humour for driving somewhere first and I don't need to cos it's just about bright enough. 

    The lack of mountains on the Northside means that the sea calls even louder when I want at it, so I decide to go directo (ish) to Fairview whence I can let the open air blow away the busyness of my midweek life and the clusterforked urbanscapes which host it. The easiest route there is to follow the simple familiar path along the canal to Ballybough, then nudge off through a few traffic lights and bingo bango it\'s the sea. But it\'s Saturday and I\'m in explorer mode and familiar paths slow down the relaxation process. I want to get back early enough so I can\'t be going too far today. I still haven\'t fully worked out how the Tolka works its way across the Northside and what impact that has had on the structure of the settlements surrounding it, so mapping that out is a good way to negate the interruptfulness of urban cycling. I\'ve seen how the river sneaks past the back of Blanchardstown village and after that it weaves through a bizarre dead space where no cars go and then it reemerges inside the Tolka Valley Park which sounds more enticing than it really is.

Between my gaff and the Tolka Valley park is a spaghetti junction where the M50 and N3 meet, but the canal and train go through too, the river is nearby, providing the historical outline for the N3, and there's a cheeky aquaduct in the mix too.  *More bridges than you've had hot dinners*, as some wit has named the Strava segment. The junction is seamless for motorists but its impact divvies up the land into four quadrants, providing multiple barrriers to what little social cohesion might be found in suburbia.

\

Castleknock is in the south and the train slash canal separate it from Blanchardstown village to the west, with the two morphing westwards into Carpenterstown, Coolmine and Clonsilla. Blanchardstown village has still managed to carve out its own niche, with several cafes, restaurants and bars, while the better known, soul-sapping Blanchardstown Shopping Centre is a smidge north, to the top left of the map, separated by perhaps the slowest traffic light system in Ireland. I find it a good spot to catch up on meditation exercises. The real commercial centre for locals is the Coolmine Industrial Estate, where you'll find papayas and falafels, mechanics and fitness studios, although no boozers or sit-down cafes. It's the only industrial estate I've ever seen which ought to transition to village status, and its existence shows how local facilities will emerge over time despite shitbox planning. 

\

In the Northern quadrant have been placed all of the large campus projects, so you get Connolly Hospital, Blanch IT, Corduff, and more recently, a swathe of high-end sports facilities, where the Olympic swimming pool finally got built, more pitches than a boarding school, and like conference rooms for the FAI. This is where the Bertie Bowl would have been, and if you need an obscure placename to remind you of the halcyon Celtic Tiger days, try this: Abbotstown. Beyond is a wodge of #BusinessParks and then the land dovetails into the dull farmlands of Meath and North County Dublin. 

\

But it is the Eastern quadrant which I have never understood fully, as the land is undeveloped and there's no park to help you follow along the river. I try to access the quadrant from Waterville Park and Connolly Hospital but I end up back on the spaghetti junction, pass over the M50, and follow the signs down and around to the suppsedly 'New' River Road.  The entrance to the road is a right turn at a junction but I decide to go straight on instead up a marked cul de sac which runs parallel to the M50. It turns out that this is the longest frikkin cul de sac you'll find in a place without mountains, and there's not much happening, beyond the noise of the cars whizzing by overhead to the left. There's a golf course, which basically explains a lot, and a nursing home. There's signs for no dumping and I take this as a red flag indicating potential criminal acitivity, and there's a car is parked at the very end of the road, so in a freak out, with far too much time to think, I decide to make sure I'm not like a witness to some crime. I think about the kid in the desert in Season Five of Breaking Bad and decide against his fate, and I spin around and piss it back down the gentle decline. Afterwards, I realise that this is the entrance to Dunsink Observatory. 

\

I turn left onto the ol' New River Road, and enjoy my safety, at least for a few moments. This road may once have been the main road to Navan but now it is the Tolka river's paltry answer to the Strawberry beds, the blissful country road which runs seven unruptured kilometres along the Liffey from Chapelizod to Lucan. The Tolka's River Road is only two kilometres and its windiness matches the meandering scuttiness of the Tolka at this point, and ramps haven't been put on the road to slow down the impatient motorists. I manage to prevent one overtaker with my outreaching palm, and wave them on after the bend, but the trick is no use for the next driver, a taxi, who passes me by on a bend and, as another car approaches, the taxi uses their skill to solve the needless problem they had created. 

\

There's a crossroads soon after, left up a dead end towards Dunsink, right to Ashtown and the main Navan road etc, and roadworks straight ahead, with access only for the canal-side apartment complexes in progress. The options aren't great, as you might expect in a null space, but I want to stick to the river, so I go straight and then have to dismount the bike in order to get into the appropriately named "Linear Tolka Vallay Park". I'll hold my thoughts for now on having to dismount a bicycle to access a park with a bike lane, and I get in to find an under-landscaped, semi-kempt park. The place is in dire need of fifty years' worth of tree growth, and the linearity is a reference to the narrow impact the park makes on the surrounding urbanscape, rather than to the direction of the paths, which which interweave in response to the steepish river banks, and the next time I'm coming here will be when me five-year-old is ready for a BMX.

It might be a bit early --- or scary --- for joggers and I plough on, disappointed that nothing pleasant has yet emerged along the Tolka, beyond my curiosity being satisfied.

, instead of lounging along the clean canal path, which provides an easy midweek commute, I decided to make more efforts at mapping the ancient route to the sea, along(side) the Tolka River, whose meandering path

To cycle into the city, I usually take the Royal Canal which, bike-lifting quibbles aside, provides a clean path all the way through Coolmine 

The simplest route from my gaff to the sea is along the Tolka river which flows unsuspectingly past the back of Blanchardstown village through the large dead zone between
