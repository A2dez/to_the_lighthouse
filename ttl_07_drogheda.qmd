title: "'Drogheda'"

April 30, 1154

Bike out. Train home. It expands your world because you can cycle twice as far and not have to deal with the misery of doubling back on freshly conquered roads. Plus, doubling your radius quadruples the area you can cover, thanks to our old friend, *Ï€r^2^*. Furtherplus, if you drive to the start point, then the island is your oyster. Ish. The East Coast at least. Today I'm off to Drogheda so I drive to Balbriggan and find an old-school car park between the sea and the park parallel to it, full of football pitches and screaming spectators. It's the kinda car park I love. Puddles and gravel, bounded by trees. There's fellas my age, ish, getting dressed for five-a-side, and chunflas in their Sunday Football Finest, walking into battle with their studs chomping orkwordly off the hard ground, as excited as a gaggle of highheeled ladies at the start of a night out. As soon as I park up, I nip into the foliage and drain the lizard goodo. Then I whip Blue Thunder out of the boot, get myself dressed, and scope out a quick bit of kids' football. That sport breaks my heart. It used to be my favourite activity in life, to play, to watch and to read about; yet I've grown up and it hasn't, so I've had to move on.

![*The old road from Balbriggan to Drogheda is not a fun place to cycle*](images/Screenshot%202023-11-19%20at%2007.06.07.png)

I leave them at it and hit the Doolittle, painfully aware that my fun occurs in solitude, not in a team. This trip'll be a piece of piss: 20k as the commuter flies, 30k on the bike, as flat as a North Leinster pancake. The only dangers are intermittent shars and the drabness of the short Meath coast. As soon as you leave County Dublin, just north of Balbriggan, the coast line has the perimeter of a straight line. The road parallel is one of those horrific secondary roads, beloved of tractors and Bus Eireann. Wide enough to drive comfortably and fast, but narrow enough to make cycling loud and miserable. After a few minutes I can smell rain so I stop off at a bus shelter. It'll be a few minutes before the shars arrive but I know they'll be heavy and I won't get shelter on this exposed road. There are some mute Ukrainians waiting for a bus and they must be housed nearby. I see a sign for an Army Camp and perhaps they are staying there, the poor things. The rain is taking longer than I expected, and it reminds me of the time that our big sister Maryanne took me and Maggs to Mosney, which is Irish for 'Butlins'. We were stuck on what mustabeen this road for donkeys waiting for the boola bus but I remember being so happy even in the delay. The rain eventually buckets down and soon the bus arrives. More Ukrainians dismount including an old lady who starts getting out her neat little umbrella. I put my hand up to tell her to stall the ball five minutes so she sits it out and, sure enough, the rain stops three minutes later. She smiles and thinks I'm a wizard, then scampers off, as do I. Of course I get hit by another shar a few minutes later so I get off, hide under a tree, and take the photo above.

It's not long before I can turn off the road towards Mosney and it's a delight because I'm into hedgerow Ireland with fields and quiet roads. I cycle down to the old holiday centre, and I can still remember the water slides and scary rides, but my fear now is for the refugees inside, locked behind bars in a reception centre. There's cameras everywhere, a security booth and some kids running around on bicycles. I can't go in for a goo, which is a shame as I could do with a trip down memory lane. This place also used to hold the Community Games, and if you want to hear a young Ryle Nugent, sounding 4% less Leinster Rugby, then check out [his narration of the 1996 games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ya_Qo2Wr-g).

So bloody unnecessary. **We went to visit my Ukrainian friend Andy in the Netherlands last year**

When the war kicked off, my Ukrainian mate Andy was off on a family holiday in Sri Lanka so when they came back to Europe the three of them moved to Arnhem in the Netherlands where our mutual friend Oskar has been putting them up, with his wife and daughter, in their city house. There wasn't even couch-space for us when we went to visit them last summer. **SAY a little more**

The bicycle situation

The bicycle situation never relents. Today I'm back on Blue Thunder, my long-standing city bike, because I haven't been arsed to fix my half-decent road bike, and I'm finally starting to accept that I actually just don't like fixing bikes, even though I want to like it, and I definitely need to like it. I keep putting my broken bikes on the long finger, saying things like I'll fix them once the house is clean. But then when I'm cleaning the gaff, I make sure go a bit deeper and move a bit of furniture and clear out a load of rubbish for the recycling, just to stretch out the clean-up job and make sure it's too late to fix the bikes. I once stayed up late to do the job and lashed on an audiobook - in between YouTube vids - and got the job done. I did feel good afterwards, but the problem is that I just don't enjoy the minutes. In recent years, I've come to understand that I'm not a builder or a fixer. I'm an explorer and a researcher, and have to deal with this tension every day in work. My core job is to build robot voices and when I'm not building them, I'm fixing bugs, and when we're not doing either of those, we have time to do more expansive projects. I'm all the time looking at anomalies and patterns, looking to find out what weird stuff is going on and how to stop it.

Each bit of discovery gives me a kick, and there'

When when I work out what the problem is, with a mix of code, imagination and a magnifying glass, I then have to build a robust computer program which can automate the process for any voice. And I never enjoy that last bit. It's really somoene else's job, cos if I'm not finding stuff out, I miss my dopamine. Building bores me and I don't get that warm fuzzy glow of the final product which I get when I fiddnd things out, or when I write. Fixing stuff is just micro-building and my favourite part is looking at the parts to see what is going on. But putting them back together is too fiddly for me. Making stuff right doesn't do it for me. Making it better does. (NOt sure about that tbh).

The next question is why I don't just go out and buy myself a good new bike. The simple answer is that we've been trying to save up to buy a house for, ooh, three years now, and so throwing money at a bike seems too lavish. Ideally, I'd be able to avail of the bike-to-work scheme, where you get a tax break for like half the price of the bike, but I've been too scared to ask work cos I'm a remote worker, and they'd have to pretend that I travel to actual work. But all I can do is ask. Meanwhile, Kilroy just reckons I don't love myself enough, and he's got a point. I've always had trouble spending money on myself, excepting holidays and booze, both of which are hashtag experiences, rather than objects. I've barely ever bought anything lavish for myself. I've got a perfectly good mid-priced phone, and an excellent work laptop. But my own laptop is an old second-hand job, and I can't remember the last time I bought an item of clothing for myself, except in TK Maxx or a charity shop. My poor wife has learnt to suffer a similar fate, and our kids have been reared on second-hand gear too, but that can come back to bite the kids so it'll be important to get them the odd bit of nice clobber. Funnily enough, paying seven grand for a Jammer never hurt so hard, but I always just see it as another form of rent, and now that we've paid off that loan, I'm thinking of maybe getting a proverbial camper van.
