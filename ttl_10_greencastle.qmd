This trip will be a tight turnaround so I get to bed early and set my alarm for 515am. But when I wake up I look at the forecast and it's even worse than I had expected, so I piss away half an hour in bed telling myself that it's not a good day to go, that I'd be better off just getting my work work done today, seeing as it is actually a Monday? Our accommodation is up in the low clouds and the far-off Mourne Mountains look even more ominous than usual. But eventually I see a ball of sunlight rising from the sea and it lifts my mood because of course the weather will be better at the sunrise coast than up here, twenty clicks inland, five hundred metres above sea level. So I decide to stop being a sofcack and just do it. I grab my heavy coat which will keep off the rain and wind and cold, even if I will be hashtag sweating like a knacker doing maths. I make myself half a pinta bogger coffee and grab a bowl of crappy-ass cereal, then I jump into the Boola Jammer cos I've got everything prepped already, knowing that this will be a hit-and-run job.

I drive twenty minutes to Newcastle, a commercialised but delightful seaside town which lies low between a stonysand beach and the blackbreasted High Mournes. From here, there are two ways to Greencastle. Nineteen miles along the Mourne Coastal Route, taking eighty-odd Google Minutes, or else a similar distance through the mountains, which I really don't want to miss, taking two Google hours. Ideally I'd get that hard part done first and saunter home along the coast, but I'm in a bit of rush, between parking, and checkout and having a job and a family, so I decide to just get there asap and see if I have time for the scenic route home. Plus the weather isn't so bad along the coast. The sea looks resplendent to the North East, whence the sun is rising, and it's a shame I'm not cycling Northward, racing into heaven. Instead I'm chasing towards hell, with black clouds bouncing black light off greygreen fields, and the only naturally occurring colours are the blue and red flags welcoming me to the settlements that break up the journey.

I decide to aim for the land closest to the lighthouse, Cranfield Point.

![*Cranfield point has a dozen or so houses perched over its stony, eastward beach, meaning you can wake up and rinse off in the waves while the kettle boils.*](images/cranfield_point_WhatsApp%20Image%202023-08-03%20at%2006.39.31.jpeg)

Cranfield Point is a reminder of where I want to live. There's a dozen or so detached houses overlooking the sea, and in the water is a women having her morning swim, which means it must be somewhat safe. I'm gaggo to get in and cool off, although much of the beach access has been cordoned off for private use, a scoobydoobious practice whose validity I need to think through. In the plus column, they've made themselves a tidy, round micro-piazza for hanging out and looking at the sea, with private steps to the beach, behind a waist-height gate. The set up is a thing of beauty and it's something I want. I once kipped on a beach hut in Thailand and had like four swims per day. You'd be in the water before brushing your teeth. It's one thing to live *near* the sea, like my mam in Clontarf, walking a kilometre down to the Bull Wall for a daily swim. It's altogether different when the sea is your basically front garden. So far I haven't seen any public access points to the long stony beach, but I cycle past the T-junction from which I came, and down the hill is another sign for a private road. But this time there is a small path into the beach and I'm delighted. I had packed my swimming shorts in my pocket but then I removed their small bulk, thinking you never get to swim beside scary lighthouses. So I decide to go full Buck Mulligan and I undress as close to the water as I can, thinking of the gawking locals with their drive-through Gospel readings, before plunging into the undulating saltbath, and washing off all of my bicycle skronk. My ability to stay in water never matches my enthusiasm, but I've learnt to get over that, and I'm in and out in a flash. I dry myself with my sweaty polo shirt and put on a nice clean cycling jersey. I had planned on using the fluffy inside of my coat, as I often do after my son declares an unplanned swim, but I decide against it as I'd be freezing my actual tits off after.

I double back out of Cranfield Point and turn left for Greencastle, following the many signs for the Carlingford Ferry. From the harbour I can see the lighthouse, distant but clear now. There's a glut of [sea creatures](http://irishlighthouses.blogspot.com/2009/08/haulbowline-range-rear.html) used to guide the ferry back and forth to Greenore, and a sparsely populated port for parking, pissing, and possibly purchasing tickets. Waiting alone in lane 1 is a family of Plastic Paddies, on tour in County Down for the week, and taking the Lee Scratch over to Carlingford to a kids adventure park. They tell me the ferry is twenty nicker one-way for a Jammer, on the hour every hour, and I resolve to bring the fam back home this way rather than via the boring old motorway. The healthy-looking grandfather tells me his dad is from Tallaght-when-it-was-a-village, and his mam is from somewhere less memorable, although from his diction alone it's clear no one here is descended from Tallaght-when-it-was-the-joyriding-capital-of-Ireland. He knows his Ireland and he pings me for suggesting that Down is a better county than the Dublin-Wicklow continuum. Soon enough we're talking about Heffo's Dubs and South-West County Dublin when it was hashtag all just fields. I have to explain that Lucan is *actually* *not* in North Kildare?, a particularly important fact today of all days, seeing as the Dubs won the All-Ireland (Series) yesterday. I tell him that my aul fella used to lodge upstairs in the Salmon Leap Pub and that he insisted on living on the Dublin side of the border when he and my mam bought a house. Family lore also says that Big Val, to win a bet, tiptoed across the railings on the bridge into Leixlip, and that was why they stuck a second tier to the railings.

I'd love to stay and ask him about growing up in the south of England with Irish parents, but it's 915am now and I have to hit the Dermot. I have just enough time to plod through the Mourne Mountains, as long as I don't stop much, and make it back to Newcastle by 1115, have a quick swim, unpark my car before getting fined, and then back to the Roisin Gaffney for a midday checkout. The wind in the mountains is fierce and even the downhill bits are a slog. After Attical, as I'm taking snaps of Slieve Muck, I see that I have just 700 feet of climbing to go, followed by 1200 feet of descending, and the thought of a long downhill victory parade keeps me going through this barren expanse. Back in Newcastle, along the promenade, I dress beside my parked car, but this time my togs fly away in the wind, so I have to swim in my poor cycling shorts. There's no one else swimming, and I don't like the pull of the retreating water so I just sit down and literally bathe. It helps to reduce my hashtag core body temperature, although afterwards I can still feel the seawater evaporate off my overheated torso. Some passers-by claim I'm a mad yoke swimming in this weather but this feels just right, and I resolve to swim at some point on every one of these lighthouse journeys.

, although I can feel the seawater evaporate off me after

and his mother from somewhere in Dublin that requires less explanation.

The owners have a made a private entrance for themselves - a scoobydoobious practice that I need to think through -

In Google Time, that's ninety minutes

But the weather is less bad along the coast and I'm in a bit of rush to get back so I decide to just get there

But I'm in a bit of a rush to get back

So I decide that I'll have to do the flatter coastal leg of the trip first, as it'll be bright there, and maybe the rain will clear off the mountains on the yomp home. So

Newcastle sits at the base of the Mourne Mountains but you won't know that from

, . So I've got the kettle on annd

Half an hour later I'm still in bed, but not ouI'm dillydallying in bed, reading bullshit recommended articles on my Tony

The forecast is brutal and I've resigned myself to having a norm
