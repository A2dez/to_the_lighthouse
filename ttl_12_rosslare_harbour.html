<h4 data-number="12.0.0.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="friday-august-25-2023"><span class="header-section-number">12.0.0.1</span> <strong>0733, Friday August 25, 2023</strong></h4>
<p>I’ve been trying for months to do this day trip to Rosslare but the stars never aligned. There were three American bank holidays in May and June, which should be good cycling days for me, but the first one was my son’s birthday, and then my octogenarian father was sick throughout June so me and my sisters were off in a Spanish hospital for the month, helping him hoik up black phlegm, night and day, as he battled off a deathly dose of covid. Right now I’m on technically holidays, meaning that I’m off work for a bit, but I’m still in Ireland, and a couple of nights of camping was understandably enough for my breastfeeding wife, so we are back home and I’m itching to get out. It’s been a mare trying to organize real holidays this year, with the Costa Living and Schengen visas and saving up for a gaff.</p>
<p>I wake up at stupid AM and check the weather on <em>Yr.no</em>. It’s going to piss in Dublin and later on in Wicklow but it’s looking fairly Canada Dry down in Wexford, bar the odd shower, so I decide to go for it. I have to clean the kitchen and empty the car of all the camping gear, then I lash my revamped Falcon bike into the back of the boola Jammer and it’s half seven agin I’m on the road. I drive about an hour to Wicklow Town where I park my car in the train station, because I’ll be coming back here later on the train from Rosslare. Our old friend, Apcoa, are taking voluntary contributions in the car park. The bastard app won’t take my three fiddy, but luckily there is a QR code and they take €4.50 for the convenience. But I know it’ll be a long day and I will be very happy to get straight into the car later on. Google Maps says it’s a 108k cycle, but I want to hug the coast and that brings it up to about 120k, a distance I’ve barely ever cycled.</p>

<section id="sdnw-migration" class="level3" data-number="12.0.1">
<h3 data-number="12.0.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sdnw-migration"><span class="header-section-number">12.0.1</span> SDNW migration</h3>
<p>I drop in to <em>Nick’s Coffee</em> to plan out the trip because I haven’t got the finer deets nailed down. I hate planning stuff in advance. I’d rather just do stuff then redo it better. I know that I’ll be taking in Arklow and probably Courtown but I’ve no idea after that, or how many beaches I’ll be able to sneakily visit. I also want to have a peak at Rosslare Strand, because it falls into that niche category of seaside village near a big town, with affordable house prices. But it turns out that the train home is at 1730, not 1830, and now I can see a big orange light flashing for the day, telling me to keep going, cos I’m going to be up against it. It’s already 0930 and there’s six cycling hours ahead of me, so that leaves only two hours of mickeying around, including my current cup of lower-end high-end coffee. Six hours is fine for a legit cyclist but a ticking clock ruins the bantersmash.</p>
<p>Nonethenevertheless, I still have a few minutes to scoop up some Wicklow Town vibes from its presumably coolest cafe. <em>Nick’s Coffee</em> used to live under an arch in Ranelagh, spitting out espressos at near-Italian prices, but for some reason they had to migrate here, presumably for not ripping people off and thus bringing the area into disrepute. There’s seats outside but I’m staying warm inside for now where I can hear Wicklow’s two-accent thing in a newer form. Now it’s between the older locals and a new breed of South Dublin / North Wicklow heads who are coming here for the hashtag quality of life. There’s a mother-of-two in the queue, a former session bird with a booming city voice, quipping repeatedly about the hardship of dragging kids through a long summer, but she’s getting no actual laughs out of anyone when all she needs is one token chuckle and maybe a cheeky hug just to get the day off on a manageable note.</p>
<p>Of course that could be me next year, or my wife, as we are thinking seriously about moving here, or even Wicklow’s less glamorous sidekick, Rathnew. Now we’ve missed the boat value-wise, but I still think it’s the best place in Leinster for us to live, given that we both want to live beside the sea, and I love cycling up mountains. South Dublin and North Wicklow are too expensive and I haven’t even bothered to show up with my magnifying glass. North Leinster is too boring geographically, with its flat coast and flat land, and I know from living in Blanch, how much of a toll that takes on me. I also can’t face spending the rest of my life in edgeless, inland suburbia, so it has to be a self-contained town. It feels like the difference between eating dinner on a table of six people, with a sense of unity, versus a long table of eight or twelve or twenty, where there is no centre and everyone’s focus is constantly shifting. The best option in North County Dublin would be Rush, but it’s a bit like the Lucan I come from, a village with a ballooning population and very little to come home to bar the resplendent beaches, upon which the sun also rises. I’m actually convincing myself as we speak. Ideally, I’d rather be in a town with more facilities, like Balbriggan, which I’ve discounted ever since someone threw a stone at me on the street, and Wicklow or maybe distant Arklow, which I’ll be visiting this morning. There you can do everything on foot or bicycle, unlike living in the middle of nowhere, where you need to drive twelve minutes every time someone wants a lollipop. Later on today I’ll be investigating the long, East Wexford coast, but my travels around South Wexford suggest the county will be just too farmy for the likes of me. And of course, I am discounting, for now, the beautiful West of Ireland, with its incessant rain, and the Responsorial Psalm of <em>So you’re Dub then, is it?</em></p>
<p>So before parking up, I actually popped in for another quick sconce at a buncha new builds we viewed in May. The estate is part of an ongoing effort to fill in the remaining gaps between the featureless village of Rathnew and the geography-rich town of Wicklow. Eugene the Estate Agent thinks they are in the middle of nowhere, cos it’s like 2.5k from his office in the town centre, but the primary school would be an eight minute walk away and that’s our most basic unit of travel. The bus to Dublin is right outside, as is the motorway, so the exit strat is decent, and you can dodge some, but not all, of the town’s infamous traffic. Plus I live on a bicycle anyway, so 2.5k is a non-distance to me, like a ten minute walk. We viewed the gaffs a couple of months ago and they told us to stall on til at least September. Then last week, a handful of gaffs came up, only the email went in to my forking spam folder and they were gonzo agin I got back to them. The next batch are due in like October slash November, which is a pain in the Gulags cos now we’ll be looking at breaking up the school year for the chunfla. The problem with new builds is that they are so frikkin dear and we’d have to either buy a terraced two-bed or do an equity share with the government. And you don’t leave home to go live in a far-off two-bed, especially if having a third child is up in the air. On the plus side though, a new estate means that you are immediately dialled in to a community of other families, namely people with mutual needs, which is the lubricant of human interaction. The fear is that we’ll end up in jobs in Dublin and have to travel bucketloads every single day. But if I limit myself to hybrid work, which I probably can, I’ll be grand, whereas my wife’s career remains a concern, and her travelling lots does worry me. But we are in no rush, so we can take our time looking for jobs that suit our needs.</p>

<p>I decide to get straight to Arklow, 25k, then Courtown, another 25k, for lunch. These are distances I can cope with and then I can worry about the rest of the day from there. I get a quick snap of Wicklow Harbour and soon I’m passing the back of Wicklow Head lighthouse. I’m very happy to be on this bike, although I’m shocked at hard it is to turn the big ring on the undulating terrain. Last week I finally fixed the issues I was having on the Balbriggan trip like three months ago. I installed a new crankset, which includes the two rings at the front plus the arms onto which the pedals are screwed on. I got myself some variable pedals, with cleats on one side for real cycling, and flat on the other for stalling in and out of town. I also had to put in a new bottom bracket to hold it all together. That’s the cylindrical fella which goes into the mysterious little pipe at the bottom of a bike frame. But I decided to up my training regime and get a bigger ring, thinking I was Victor Campanaerts, and now my unpracticed legs can’t turn the feckin wheels, so it feels like I’m dragging my four-stone six-year-old on the back. There’s no way I’ll be able for six hours of this, and I’ll have to get used to it on short midweek rides, so I settle in to a rhythm for now using the smaller chainring, inasmuch as you can with the never-ending up-and-down roads on this lowlumpy island.</p>

<p>The coast road to Arklow is surprisingly empty with no proper villages en route, unless you include caravan parks, or the blink-and-you’ll-miss-it Brittas Bay, and it feels like some distributional law of mathematics is being broken. Surely it must be possible to get mass or source a pint of stout either side of a day’s labour? But the coast is cliffy, and there are no harbours, thus no fishing villages. Dwelling-wise, there seem to be a lot of sizeable houses locked away behind thick electric gates, and plenty of them must own a chunk of the coast. <a href="https://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/ep/p-cpp1/censusofpopulation2022profile1-populationdistributionandmovements/populationdistribution/">Later inspection</a> shows that these are the East Coast’s electoral districts with the lowest population density. The low-ish cliffs are broken up by intermittent strands, including the famous Brittas Bay and a delectable smaller variant we went to this summer, Magherabeg. Unlike the smaller (sic) Magheramore just north, which is owned and guarded by Wolohan’s caravan park, Magherabeg has a makeshift field nearby for parking, but then you have to drag your beach gear along in festival-like fashion. It gave me real pleasure to hand over five nicker to some local teenagers, rather than three fiddy to faceless pricks with fat yellow clamps. Another few coves dot the coast before Arklow and I spot one or two swimmers re-emerging, like amphibians with car keys, and that sense of having already won the day.</p>

</div>
<p>Arklow, it turns out, is a river town near the sea, like Dublin or Wexford or Drogheda, and you have to make a little effort to get to the coast, whereas in Wicklow the sea is right there, so you can instantly dodge all the towniness, like Dun Laoghaire. I cross the bridge, where they seem to be adding a boardwalk along the river, then I turn left towards the harbour - still the river - and then I remember there stands a light taken from an old lightship. I grab a photo from the other side of the quay, but the light’s internal prettiness is masked by the visual overload of its surroundings, with a round block of apartments nearby and masts sticking up irregularly from the marina behind. By contrast, I recall another lightship light sitting resplendent on a roundabout connecting Arklow to the motorway, where its complex beauty is highlighted by its simple round grass frame. Roundabout art is rare in Ireland and we could really do with more of it. They are like a modern version of the lighthouse, marking out spaces to avoid along our travel paths. My wife says they are on a different level in her native Oman, and it’s yet another thing to see there when we are finally welcomed.</p>
<p>I reconned Arklow a couple of months ago when we were stalling it down to Wexford, and I was more impressed by the outdoor facilities emerging north of the river than the main town arcking up a hill on the south side of what must be a trafficky bridge. The place, to be fair, was as dead as you’d expect on a Bank Holiday Monday, but that only highlighted my diminishing interest in Irish towns with their Battle Cruisers, bookies and perfunctory shite like estate agents and solicitors. And cars parked everywhere. I’m just waiting for the big day when the towns all get pedestrianised and turned into long piazzas full of places to hang out, where adults loiter on the edges, drinking their pints of bubble tea and kids recreate their video games in the flesh. We might even see unobtrusive sports like bowls and badminton. Careful inspection shows that this situation already exists for like eighty metres at the top of Dublin’s recently pedestrianised Capel St.&nbsp;Malahide has also introduced a pedestrianised street, although I don’t recall that anyone thought of the kids, or indeed anyone who would like to be there without spending cash.</p>

</div>
<p>The river feeds, unsurprisingly, into to the sea, and roadworks block the path. There is a definitely a sense of urgency in this town that people are living here and need facilities after a supposedly brutal dose of recession. I nudge through the traffic cones before coming to Arklow South Beach, which is a bit of a #LeinsterBeach, but there’s a few families here using the sand as a free babysitter, and I’m asking people if they know whether I can cycle along the coast. The problem is that there is a quarry in the way, with a big pointy hill getting its guts nibbled out. Google Maps wants me to avoid it, even though it does display road-like paths between here and the other side. Everyone claims not to be local, so I punch on inanyways and a local dogwalker tells me there is a gravel path around the quarry, if I stay left of the fence, which I do. I come to The Cove, a slightly nicer beach where a boulder welcomes us with a spraypainted announcement that <em>This beach is not a dog’s toilet</em>. I’ve noticed quite a lot of these signs around Wicklow where the people really seem to be standing up for themselves. There’s also quite a bit of community art around the place, another strong sign that a lot of fucks are indeed given round here.</p>

</div>
<p>Back on the rough gravel path, I’m worried I might get a puncture, although I’m glad my 28mm tyres aren’t stupidly skinny. Did I prepare properly last night and pack a puncture repair kit and pump? No, your Honour, I took a needless chance this morning. The path is very steep in parts and hard to grip, so I have to dismount at one point, then I incorrectly choose a left and come to the sumptuous Hanging Rock Beach, to which I’ll be returning. The climb back up the slippy terrain is a nice workout for the legs and the cleats on my new pedals are a real help. From the top you can see more little beaches with caravan parks hanging out the back of them, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CebWRaBtdIA">here is some tasty drone footage</a>. I descend out the other side, into the last couple of kilometres of the wondrous county of Wicklow in which I think I want to live.</p>

<p>While I’m not yet in technically Wexford, it feels like I’ve already entered a new place now as the terrain is that bit flahher. I’m excited to finally see the domestic tourism scene in this county, where you hear reports of hashtag Real Dubs coming and supposably overrunning the place, although that sounds like decent craic to me, at least for the first three hours. The first sign of life comes from an explorer aunt out on her bike, and a few clicks later I see a gastro pub on the side of the road advertising an upcoming performance of Roddy Doyle’s <em>The Snapper</em>. But there are no people. Just road and farms, and the odd sign for honey and eggs for sale. I continue on around Tara Hill, where an elderly lady refuses me permission to photo <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@52.7058863,-6.2110878,3a,60y,204.25h,94.99t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s_2-XwHeTZsoMRnfi0MLroQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?hl=en&amp;entry=ttu">her cute house</a>, then I turn left for Ballymoney and Courtown, where the mobile homes start to stack up, and then the housing estates for some possibly long-distance commuters. I’m delighted to have this chunk of the trip dunzoed and I’m ready for a swim and some scran. It’s 1215 now so I’m on skedj, but I won’t have time for a thorough investigation.</p>
<p><br>
I expected Courtown to have a long sprawling beach, like what everyone bangs on about in Wexford, and which I’ve been half-avoiding, but actually it’s a fishing harbour with low cliffs at the south end, and little scutty beaches scattered along the shore. It’s not even obvious where I ought to swim but I see a few teenage Dubs in wetsuits who look like they’ve been transplanted here from Grand Canal Dock and they are climbing down some awkward steps to get to the water. Other people are walking along a path in the grass. My problem is that I don’t have a little lock for this bike cos the poundshop lock I bought has rusted and the key is stuck. The sociologist in me is gaggo to follow the lads, but the item-heavy middle-aged man in me is telling me to push on. A German couple tell me there’s a beach at the end of the short road, Keltennel Bay beach apparent, which bizarrely sits in an evergreen wood. No one is here except for a humourless couple with a toddler, doing their duty, and a grandad with his maybe nine-year-old granddaughter, trying to convince her to get in to the water without setting any kind of example himself. I whip out Kilroy’s tiny swimming jocks and lounge in the instantly deep water for fully two minutes, a season’s best. Rain starts spitting as I get out and I’m bricking it cos I’ve got seventy k to go and less than five hours before the train departs. But a change of jersey is very welcome and my light jacket keeps the spitting rain out.</p>
<p>I don’t have time for a sit-down meal so I order fish and chips from a takeaway, which is not a great mid-exercise choice, and while I wait for it I sit round the corner with a meh coffee, jotting down notes for what is written above. I’m also trying to soak in the atmos but it’s not a people-watching paradise, due to its clusterfucked layout. Your classic seaside pattern goes sea, beach, parallel promenade, shops, and road behind. People watching is easy because they come and they go, paralleling along like everything else. But here it’s all mixed up. The harbour is at the centre, with a small river cutting diagonally across. The beaches are split either side of the town, with that small cliffy headland to the south, and the village cuts back perpendicularly from the harbour. Parked cars soak up what could be a small piazza, and there’s nowhere much to sit out and eat. This cafe has some low wooden benches and high wooden casks, but the cask makes it easier to hide my food on my lap while I have the odd sip of coffee. I gobble up the fish and put half the chips in my teeny backpack, using them to separate my little wet towel from the last of my dry clothes for the train home. The kiosk in the car park is particularly pretty so I ask the aul fella if I can get a snap. He says yes and that a lot of people take a picture, then I feel guilty and order an ice-cream, which is exactly what I don’t need. I misframe the photo so I’m not printing it here. I’ve actually go no even half-decent photos of Courtown, possibly because its layout doesn’t lend itself to a 2D shot. I hit the road in a flurry and I’m disappointed that I haven’t rested my brain enough for another couple of hours of observation.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>The next forty five kilometres are very much the loneliness of the long-distance runner, so I just keep my head down to get them dunzoed. I lash on a podcast for once cos I need a break from my unrested brain. Signposts indicate Curracloe, 30k away, so I use that as my next goal even though I no longer expect to see its famous beach. I’m starting to understand that this so-called coast road is actually just an inland distributor road, running parallel to the coast, and you have to turn off it to get to the villages and beaches. So instead of Cahore Point on the coast, I get to see inland Ballygarrett, which is full-on Heart of Darkness stuff, with petrol pumps outside a small shop, and a monster church built after Emancipation for a population that can no longer fill it. 8k later is the larger village-town of Kilmuckridge, which has been colonised by the Tidy Towns people. Its coastal partner is Morriscastle Strand. I stop off for fluids in a surprisingly fancy Centra, which has modelled itself on post-merger Super Valu, but of the Superquinn kind, rather than the shoddy Bogger Valus that used to drain rural cash in exchange for limp carrots. The place seems to be a magnet for ageing ladies, dressed to the sevens, hoping to bump into their next social engagement. Across from the Centra sits Wexford House which may well be a factory for hanging baskets. 9k later I’m in Blackwater, an ancient-looking village, with a couple of shops older than your granda. It looks like it has worked hard to preserve its history, but some very modern tractors plough through it, being harvest season, and we all get stuck behind some roadworks. I can feel my legs now missing their sparkle on the short uphill exit out of the town, although I have a nice little race against one of the tractors as it struggles to negotiate the traffic cones which mark out the roadworks. Yet again it’s like 8 or 9k to the next village, Curracloe, whereby no man is ever more than 4 or 5k from his pint or priest, that being as far as one could reasonably walk to and fro on the reg. Sure enough, it’s just a junction village with a road to the nearby beach, so I sit down for a suppa water then punch on a few more clicks to Wexford Town.</p>

<p>Arriving in Wexford Town gives me that now-familiar joy of arriving back in civilization, and the upsloping settlement across the wide river looks deloosh in the sunshine. It’s 345 now and I’ve got thirty mins max to go all Ford Prefect on the situation, so I make a beeline for the boozer where I can get a quick Britney and a packa peanuts. I almost feel like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UhT6-GntcY">these Tour de France riders</a> from back in the hashtag who would run into cafes and steal a wodge of booze and stuff it back into their jerseys, to be drunk while they chase back on to the peleton. In my case I hit The Undertaker, which should be outdoor pinting heaven, but the bar is understaffed and the aul lad takes fifteen full minutes to serve me a sharp pint of Moretti. I slobber it down and barely have enough time to sort out all the shite in my pockets before it’s time to leg it. This place should be people-watching heaven but again, that’s not a task for the frantic. It’s 415 now and the train is at 530.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>Google Maps is sending me on some roundabout journey, turning 17k into 24, and putting me under severious time pressure. The signs are telling me otherwise and I realize that something is up when it tells me to take a left <em>off</em> the N25 down some L-road, when all the Jammers and lorries are zipping along this, the Rosslare road. Obviously some gom in Google Maps has confused Motorways with National roads, cos I’ve since started to notice a pattern. Now lookit, you wouldn’t plan your Sunday spin around this noise but you’d certainly take it over missing your Boola train and being stranded in one of the four corners of Ireland. I also have to take the L on scoping out Rosslare Strand as a place to live, but I’m no longer pushed because I know I don’t want to live anywhere in Wexford. If I’m going to be this far from Dublin, then I’d rather be somewhere more dramatic. Mind you the pancake flat land out this side of the town is working in my favour and I can finally power towards my final destination in the big ring. There’s a sign saying 6k to Rosslare Harbour and I haven’t felt this good since Jason McAteer scored against Holland in 2001. I can see the top of the ferry in the distance, beyond the flat fields, and it looks like the roof of a circus tent, advertising itself via shape and colour. The built up area arrives and I feel a rare sense of synergy with the place as everything relates to my destination, the harbour, to which all the lorries and many of the cars are headed. After the traditional village of Kilrane, everything starts to scream at you, American-style, from the side of the road. Eat here. Sleep here. Refuel here. The pyramidal church from the 1960s confirms the modernity of the place. I stop to take stock and a lorry spatters me with minutes-old rainwater, but it feels lucky, like birdshit on your shoulder, and I’m reminded that I’ve dodged God’s pee all day long. I think about grabbing some scran and a celebratory beer for the train, but I decide to just get to the station, buy my ticket and then head to the lighthouse, planning to pig out on the two-hour train ride back.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="images/lightbouse_rosslare_from_the_cliffs.jpeg" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption><em>The little lighthouse is inaccessible to the public unless you make prior arrangements with the harbourmaster or like whatever.</em></figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The road descends to the harbour on the left, while a low cliff to the right provides a perch for the locals to live. There is no train station, just a platform and ticket machine behind a wodge of makeshift fencing. A train worker is arriving in work and I ask him how I get to the lightouse but he tells me it’s inaccessible, and the only way I’ll even see it is from the cliff above. So I grab my bike and, thinking I’m a cyclo-cross hero, l lug it up fifty-odd steps whence I can look back over the scaldyball harbour whose aesthetic, one might argue, operates at a magnitude greater than that of the individual. I still have fifteen minutes to play with so I ask the security guards if I can stall in towards the lighthouse. I make it through the first two entry levels but the last one gives me a hard no, and it’s fair enuffski, as this isn’t some pissy tourist operation we’re dealing with here, like Hook Head. It’s also not the last disappointment of the Doris Day. I cycle back with my tail between my legs and, on boarding the train, I find that they no longer sell food or water, let alone cheeky cans. This has been the case ever since Craig David, according to the smug conductor, who squeezes in a cheeky bit of beration for me not booking a spot for my bike. I am thankful for the cold, soggy chips in my bag and the lady opposite offers me half her water bottle. I offer her chocolate in return and we talk camper vans for a while, but I need to write and she wants to read. I change into some vinegar-infused clean clothes, and two slow hours later I’m back in my car, craving a McDonalds milkshake. I find a recovery drink in a petrol station and hit the motorway, thinking I might be doing this drive a lot more, #goingforward.</p>
