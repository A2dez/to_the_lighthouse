**0354, Monday November 20, 2023**

I knew I'd wake up early cos my mind has been racing of late although I didn't think it'd be this frikkin early. I don't even bother wasting time trying to go back to sleep. I throw my bike into the MC Hammer and I lob my mam's hoover in too cos I keep forgetting to drop it back to her, and their gaff is kind of on the way. I'm outta the gaff by 450 and I've to drive 200 clicks to Dungarvan, on the Munsterier side of Waterford county. From there, I'm aiming to see Mine Head Lighthouse in the Waterford Gaeltacht, then Youghal Lighthouse in the People's Republic of Cork, a county I'm most excited about exploring. The cycle will be an 85k loop, when you factor in the whole coastline and I'm hoping to get it all done during the day's light. From 8am to 4pm. They don't bother with trains in this part of the country so I have to cycle back, which is always miserable.

On the motorway my mind is composing beautiful sentences, and I have them all written down in my head, but I can't hang on to them like I can on the bike. The world changes at the wrong speed. This becomes even more obvious after I drop the hoover off, because Google Maps sends me across the back roads from the N4 to the M7, and now I'm burning good brain energy in negotiating narrow roads in the dark. I could have vetoed Maps and doubled back along the dual carriageway, minimising brain use, but the complaint ends up being academic because the whole drive is an exercise in wasting good energy, negotiating cars in the dark. By the time I park up on the near side of Dungarvan at 8am, I've pissed away the best of my day's brain power and I'm not even on the Paul van yet. Yes, I enjoyed listening back to Mary Anne Hobbes's legendary [Dubstep Warz radio show](https://www.mixcloud.com/MaryAnneHobbs/dubstep-warz/) from 2006, a buncha mini DJ sets showcasing the best producers and MCs from the era, but my #learning is that a 200k drive in the morning is way too much and henceforth I'll need to sleep in the vicinity of my starting points. You want to be putting your best energy into the most important part of the journey, exploring new places, and translating that into words. Because as the day progresses, I can't generate as much thought, and that's why these pieces are always so opening-heavy. On the flip side, I am reminded that cycling is good for my writing. Something about its speed and physicality engages my brain at the right pace, kinda like classes with a marker on the whiteboard, where the teacher's writing matches the speed at which students can absorb information, unlike Powerpoint which is for demonstrating what you know.

The M8 is as unremarkable in the dark as the light, and when it brings me to Waterford, I turn right onto the N25 for Dungarvan, a half decent national secondary road, with commuters coming in the opposite direction, presumably praying that they'll one day stick in a motorway between Cork and Waterford. The rain has been bucketing down the whole way through Rest of Leinster, but *Yr.no* says it is to be clear on the coast after sunrise, while the radio says there'll be nay rain shars araind. Sure enough, it's nice and bright on my arrival in Dungarvan, which sits like a miniature Dublin, inside into a protected bay, a river splitting it in two even-ish parts, and hills to its admittedly north, although it'll be a few decades before they have to fend off the sprawl. I've got a play-it-by-ear coffee appointment arranged with an old friend's brother, so I'm marginally less chill than I'd normally be, or else the drive has just put me on edge. I park up outside Dungarvan's Pay and Display zone, with the goal of having a good gawk through it. It's nearly 9am by the time I get the bike out and re-prep my oversized bag, with a full change of gear, emergency tools and enough scran for the Doris. The town is busy with parking issues and school drop offs so I'm eager to get across the river and out the other side. In theory I could take the main road to Youghal, by-passing the wide, D-shaped peninsula on which Mine Head sits, then loop back along the coast, taking in as much as time allows, but the itch in me wants to see the entirety of the coastline, despite the hassle. So I decide to take the main road on the return leg and I send Fitzy my live location cos he says he'll catch up with me once the kids are in school.

![](images/IMG_20231120_090832.jpg)

The left turn off the N25 brings me towards the tiny Waterfod Gaeltacht, which is a peninsula off the peninsula, and I'm guessing its isolation prevented the Saxon tongue from invading fully The road signs are in Irish only and the English has been deleted, which is a weird choice because if Irish were to re-emerge as the lingua franca across the country, then you'd expect there'd be a need to retain the English placenames out of respect for all the poor Saxonites whose language had been lost or marginalised. Luckily I can work out the placenames. *Ceann Heilbhic* is Helvick Head, which I'm going to check out now, even though it's a few clicks out of the way. The 'vick' is the same root as the 'wick' of *Wicklow*, being Old Norse for 'bay'. *An Seanphobal* is Old Parish where the Fitzgeralds are from. *An Rinn* is *Ring*, which has an Irish-speaking boarding school, and I'm looking forward to seeing its setting. A bunch of lads I was in secondary school with went there for sixth class and came into first year with what seemed like fluent Irish. All I knew from my interdenominational education was *Ní raibh scamall sa spéir*, the first line in the solitary textbook I had ever seen, *Bog Liom*. Bizarrely our secondary school just lobbed all levels in together and I never managed to get up to speed, a problem that was aided by my attitude to the language and my lifelong inability to work hard on things I'm not interested in. I remember really pissing off my Irish teacher in fifth year because he caught me down the back of the class, reading some novel in French, and soon enough I just dropped to Pass Irish and made it my eighth subject for the Leaving. But in fairness to Mr Nugent, he spoke Irish to us in class, unlike most Irish teachers, and all of our French teachers, which is mental. If you never hear the frikkin thing, you can't just lick it up off the page. I know from 5000 hours of teaching English as a foreign language (and yeah I've counted, and yeah I miss it) that you actually can teach people from scratch, using objects and tasks and body language, and it's a shame that such methods weren't applied in our Irish teaching. I've sent my son to a Gaelscoil, even though I've never developed a real grá for the language, because I feel like it's the least I can do to help the language revive, and there is legiterally nothing to be lost for him. I don't expect to hear much Irish now either, seeing as I'll only be here for a few minutes.

Helvick Head is less striking than I'd hoped, although the grey clouds don't exactly draw out the sparkle from the concrete harbour, or even the wide vista across the whole bay, and you'd probably want to walk beyond the cul the sac to see the best of the rock. I fish around for good photos (in vain) and I'm about to stall on when James Fitz pulls up beside me in a white SUV, delighted that the live location feature on WhatsApp has resolved our rendezvous problem. He tells me to double back down to the harbour, where *Solas na Mara* sits, a wellness centre with a cafe, and the place is so clean that I take off my cycling shoes before entering. James is appalled at the hack of me, with my ancient bike and high-viz jacket, and bag on my back, but he's too polite to say anything yet. We've never spoken before. He's my schoolfriend Richard's older brother and he was two years ahead of us in school. But there's always a shared experience there, so it's a wee bit like going on a movie date, except the film was six years long and there's been two decades of aftermath. The people here know him and it's nice to watch a teeny bit of the tight-nit rural community in action. It's something I have always craved. He asks for the physio to come over when he gets a chance and then we sit down with our coffees for some rapid-fire catch up. Richard being Richard, the madzer, running a media empire in the Middle East. William, their younger brother, who works in Silicon Valley, and whom I would have met out there only for Covid lockdown. James asks me if I regret leaving the States so abruptly in 2020. I started my current job there, three days before lockdown kicked in, and then we bounced after four months, having met basically no one. It's a frank question and it hits deep because I realise now that I do regret it, even though we were just unlucky that a pandemic coincided with the opportunity of a lifetime - eighteen months of working in Silicon Valley. Only now do I know that I sometimes get anxiety attacks, or something similar, and I freak out and run. In that case I dragged my whole family back across the world. That's kinda why I cycle to lighthouses. I can formalize my need to run away before it takes over. Previously, I probably just went on benders.

The physio comes over and James is eager for me to tell all about my lighthouse escapades. It's nice to hear myself presented from a different angle cos you don't want to be always volunteering unsolicited plans to everyone. James tells him about his banjoed knee, how it gave in during the Dublin City Marathon a few weeks back, and he points to his beanie commemorating the event. He was on course for the family record but the knee gave in and young Michael still holds it at around 3.30 or so. It's beautiful to watch the family rivalry, all six of them pushing each other, whether always conscious or not, I don't know. The second last time I had a sporting rivalry with my five siblings was playing tennis against Maggs when I was thirteen and she was sixteen, although I did come back from the dead and beat my grown-up nephew in bowling just last week and that felt *extra* good.

![trihub](images/IMG_20231120_152511.jpg)

It turns out the James owns a new triathlon shop in Youghal and I'd've dropped in to him there if it hadn't been Monday, his day off. I'm expecting that we'll end up talking about triathlons, which my mam was big into, and I've always wondered whether her dad's death fed into her ambitions, and whether the Fitzes' dad's death has driven them on too. She had the double trauma of being sent off to boarding school after he died, and so did the Fitzes. But we are either too short on time or I don't know how to ask the questions. Instead we end up talking about the day-to-day pressures of stocking a shop, and Christmas opening hours and how to balance it all against the joyous intensity of child-rearing. What's exciting though, is that James is up for coming on a cycle with me in the new year, and showing me how to do it properly, which I badly need. I'm guessing we'll go from Youghal to Roche's Point lighthouse, on the eastern entrance to Cork Harbour, and maybe look at Ballycotton lighthouse from the land, as there'll be no ferries running til later in the year. It'll be great to get to know him better and experience his intensity across the timeframe it deserves.

**Paid Morrissey**

I don't know if he honks at me or I just hear him or what, but I turn around and wave and cycle back up to him. He's as gentle as the collie at the door and I tell him that I was just with James.

He introduces himself as Paid Morrissey

Mine Head Lighthouse

James's daughter and Paid's granddaughter are in naoinra together

Accent is Sean Kelly's

I ask him to tell me a bit about the lighthouse and he starts out in proto-tour-guide mode with a spiel about it being built in 1851 and it being the highest lighthouse in the country, (wording) but I can now hold a conversation about a lighthouses so he chills a bit and we just talk for a while. He's not sure why the tower is so high, given that it's perched on top of a cliff, but there's nothing but fucking fog around here so maybe the height helps. The problem is that the records have all been lost as they were burnt in the London Blitz, wudyabelieve. He is sad that he doesn't know who owned the land back then, and I forget to ask him how long the land has been in his family. Like elsewhere, there seems to have been a bit of brouhaha over ownership of the land, although Paid is too mild-mannered to grouse openly. The lighthouse and grounds belong to the Commissioners of Irish Lights (CIL) but the road is his, and he put his foot down when they wanted to whip out the old Fresnel Lens. Their trump card is the presence of mercury, a substance that may have been the ruin of many's a lighthouse keeper. I didn't catch the exact resolution

The road down is as rough and sloppy as on any cattle farm and I probably should walk in case I get a puncture. But it's fun to do a bit of cyclo-cross even though I misjudge one corner and skid into a manure-filled puddle. Luckily I stay upright and plough on as far as the lighthouse campus. There is a red gate, in need of paint, with CIL welded into it, and a sizeable wall along the laneway to the lighthouse and around its grounds' perimeter. One of Páid's fields fills the space between the lane and the sheer cliffs below, so I rest the bike against the gate and plod across its sog. The wall is lower in one spot so I scale it there and stroll down to the tall.

I will need my car key at the end of the day, but I don't need the other hundy grams of house keys and key rings. I also need proper warm gear, designed for cyclists.

Other than that, this just looks like normal Ireland, with lumpy roads and big green fields. Now that I'm cycling properly I have to stop for a change of costume as I'm too warm, so I stuff my blue Regatta jumper back in to the miserable bag on my back whose strings are already starting to pull at my. I really need to get a panier rack on the back of this bike, and then I can lob whatever I need for the day into a panier.

**Richard Fitz**

\- The most soccer-mad kids in a boarding school where you had to fill your time with something.

\- Both of us were Blackburn fans and when one of us was sick we asked the other to come join in the infirmary, which was a thing. It was a refuge from the day-to-day life of school, the only place in the school where you could make toast or sit on your Gordon. Funnily enough, I was up there with nasty asthma, hooked up to a nebuliser, while the eponymous Gordon D'Arcy, in fifth year at the time, was visiting his mate and munching on toast eating toast. I had some kind of panic attack, and D'Arce had to rescue me, which was something I was incredibly proud of. Even in school, D'Arcy was a celebrity, and two years later, he was playing in the rugby World Cup. He actually went a wee bit off the rails for a few years after, just like all of us who spent their teenage years locked up in a boarding school, and the only difference being that he was missing Ireland caps while the rest of us weren't arsed showing up for club matches.

-   Later he got into new media stuff. He had this blog called 52 Burrito Dates

I've an old mate from round here called Richard Fitzgerald and I last caught up with him at our twenty-year school reunion last summer. He flew home from Dubai on the Friday, did a half iron man in Youghal on the Saturday morning, and then stalled it up to meet us in Blessington that evening. On the Sunday morning, we loaded his bike in my car and I dropped him off in the airport whence he flew back to Dubai to continue running his media empire. Although in fairness he was running it from his Tony all morning. It was a great chance to chat to an old friend who has built up something and to see how he does it.

He was reading about CEOs and football men when we were fourteen, fifteen.

I never had any interest in business but he managed to see the link and make the transition and even a cursory check online shows him talking about applying football or tennis pressure to your business life.

So I texted Fitz last night to see if he had any suggestions and he sent my his brother James's number. As it happens, he's just opened up a triathlon shop in Youghal and I thought I might catch him there or for coffee but he's off of a Monday and so we work out a plan here in Waterford. I send him my live location and, once the kids are in school, he just pursues me in his Jammer and catches me at Helvick Head, at the southern extremity of Dungarvan Bay.

**Mine Head lighthouse**

I'm always amazed at how sturdy lighthouses can be, as shockingly gargantuan in stature as a forward in international rugby. This one is painted black and white like a Barbarian, and set beside it are two cottages, and more thick walls separating them and marking out two plots which were surely used for growing vegetables.

-   Something about the bit where the light is (blocked off, boarded up)

-   Some nice sunlight

-   Can't capture the drop to the sea, but the photo of other cliffs might do

nd thankfully there's an electric barb wire fence demarking the field and preventing me from going dangerously close to the edge.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Ardmore bound**

Punch on. - Not a lot done, much more to do. It's 29k to Youghal and 32 if I go via Ardmore, so I decide to check it out for completion, and Richard suggested it.

-   It's as mild a day as you'll get in November, twelve or thirteen degrees, with the sun breaking out from the clouds, yet the wind remains fierce and you can see its impact on the echelon-shaped trees which grow in response to the prevailing wind. All day I'm putting on and off my magic gloves.

-   I barely meet a car and I get lost in thought so I must have been in the zone. One day these serene roads will be filled with leisure cyclists and, in preparation for their coming, they have already been marked out as part of the Euro Velo project, which has the decency to include Wexford, Waterford and East Cork, unlike the Wild Atlantic Way. For now, the tourists remain glued to the West Coast, yet everyone has to compete for space along the few roads that got built along its craggy terrain. Here, where the land is good enough for cattle farming, and oodles of road connect it all up, cycling is perfect, because cars and lorries can zoom along the main road (N25), while no one comes to this appendix peninsula.

-   must compete for space along the few roads

-   

-   This part of the country has the same misfortune as the second- or third-prettiest sister in a family of stunners.

-   

-   of being like the second or third best-looking

The next two journeys both involve people I know

I also hate driving in the dark because I have a light sensitivity condition and I can't wear the midnight blue lenses I need to make the world look calm.

although it's not big enough to be the only connection between the cities of Cork and Waterford

**Dungarvan**

The view over Dungarvan is spectacular but it's cloudy, misty and nearly dark, so I don't bother taking a photo. It reminds me of a smaller Dublin, with a circular bay and a low-lying town where the river meets at the centre. On the far side of the town is a ring of hills and it's obviously elevated here on the Youghal side as I can see over the town, having dragged my knackered body up the long drag. It doesn't take much imagination fill in a bigger town, unlike poor Youghal which is like barnacles stuck to a hill.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Thanksgiving**

I'm off work for Thanksgiving week so it's a good chance to catch up on some lighthouses.

I actually thought it'd be next Thursday, but it turns out that Thanksgiving is on the fourth Thursday of November (the 23rd) not the last Thursday of November (the 30th), so it's a good thing I didn't book some winter sun in Morocco, like last year, when the chunfla was jumping waves in Taghazout. Instead, he's in school and I've got a big of #metime. **Not sure it's worth including this**

0454, Monday November 20, 2023

Thanksgiving is this Thursday so I'm off work for the week. Now I actually though it'd be next week, cos I assumed Thanksgiving was on the last Thursday of November (the 30th), rather than the fourth Thursday (the 23rd), so I've no holidays booked. Plus we've just gone sale agreed on a gaff in Wicklow Town so there's not much cash floating around for Winter Sun, like last year's cheeky week in Taghazout, Morocco. So anyway, I"m driving to Dungarvan today, 200 clicks away, and then heading west, to - Tiredness
