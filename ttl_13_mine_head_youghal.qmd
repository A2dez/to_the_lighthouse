**0354, Monday November 20, 2023**

I knew I'd wake up early cos my mind has been racing of late although I didn't think it'd be this frikkin early. I don't even bother wasting time trying to go back to sleep. I throw my bike into the MC Hammer and I lob my mam's hoover in too cos I keep forgetting to drop it back to her, and their gaff is kind of on the way. I'm outta the gaff by 450 and I've to drive 200 clicks to Dungarvan, on the Munsterier side of Waterford county. From there, I'm aiming to see Mine Head Lighthouse in the Waterford Gaeltacht, then Youghal Lighthouse in the People's Republic of Cork, a county I'm most excited about exploring. The cycle will be an 85k loop, when you factor in the whole coastline and I'm hoping to get it all done during the day's light. From 8am to 4pm. They don't bother with trains in that part of the country so I have to cycle back, which is the miserable part.

### The Benga Bus

On the motorway my mind is composing beautiful sentences, and I have them all written down in my head, but I can't hang on to them like I can on the bike. The world changes at the wrong speed. This becomes even more obvious after I drop the hoover off, because Google Maps sends me across the back roads from the N4 to the M7, and now I'm burning good brain energy in negotiating narrow roads in the dark. I could have vetoed Maps and doubled back along the dual carriageway, minimising brain use, but the complaint ends up being academic because the whole drive is an exercise in wasting good energy, negotiating cars in the dark. By the time I park up on the near side of Dungarvan at 8am, I've pissed away the best of my day's brain power and I'm not even on the Paul van yet. Yes, I enjoyed listening back to Mary Anne Hobbes's legendary [Dubstep Warz radio show](https://www.mixcloud.com/MaryAnneHobbs/dubstep-warz/) from 2006, a buncha mini DJ sets showcasing the best producers and MCs from the era, but my #learning is that a 200k drive in the morning is a bad use of good energy and henceforth I'll need to sleep in the vicinity of my starting points. You want to be putting your best energy into the most important part of the journey, exploring new places, and translating that into words. Because as the day progresses, I can't generate as much thought, and that's why these pieces are always so opening heavy and then reliant on photographs as the day progresses. On the flip side, I am reminded that cycling is good for my writing. Something about its speed and physicality engages my brain at the right pace, kinda like classes with a marker on the whiteboard, where the teacher's writing matches the speed at which students can absorb information, unlike Powerpoint which is for showing what you know (off).

### Dungarvan

The M8 is as unremarkable in the dark as the light, and when it brings me to Waterford, I turn right onto the N25 for Dungarvan, a half-decent national secondary road, with commuters coming in the opposite direction, presumably praying that they'll one day stick in a motorway between Cork and Waterford. The rain has been bucketing down the whole way through Rest of Leinster, but *Yr.no* says it is to be clear on the coast after sunrise, while the radio says there'll be nay rain shars araind. Sure enough, it's nice and bright on my arrival in Dungarvan, which sits like a miniature Dublin, inside into a protected bay, a river splitting it in two even-ish parts, and hills to its admittedly north, although it'll be a few decades before they have to fend off the sprawl. I've got a play-it-by-ear coffee appointment arranged with an old friend's brother, so I'm marginally less #chill than I'd normally be, or else the drive has just put me on edge. I park up outside Dungarvan's Pay and Display zone, with the goal of having a good gawk through the town. It's nearly 9am by the time I get the bike out and re-prep my oversized bag, with a full change of gear, emergency tools and enough scran for the entire Doris. The town is busy with parking issues and school drop offs so I'm eager to get across the river and out the other side. In theory I could take the main road to Youghal, by-passing the wide, D-shaped peninsula on which Mine Head sits, then loop back along the coast, taking in as much as time allows, but the itch in me wants to see the entirety of the coastline, despite the hassle. So I decide to take the main road on the return leg and I send Fitzy my live location cos he says he'll catch up with me once the kids are in school.

### Ringsend

![](images/IMG_20231120_090832.jpg)

The left turn off the N25 brings me towards the tiny Waterfod Gaeltacht, which is a peninsula off the peninsula, and I'm guessing its double isolation slowed the spread of Saxon tongue. The road signs are in Irish only and the English has been perversely deleted in [an exercise of quotuquote equality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_Languages_Act_2003). Luckily I can work out the placenames. *Ceann Heilbhic* is Helvick Head, where I'm going now, even though it's a smidge off route. The 'vick' is also 'wick' of *Wicklow*, being Old Norse for 'bay', and might even be the 'vik' of *viking*. *An Seanphobal* is Old Parish where the Fitzgeralds are from. *An Rinn* is *Ring*, like Dublin's Ringsend, meaning headland. It has an Irish-speaking boarding school, and I'm looking forward to seeing its setting. A bunch of lads from my secondary school with there for sixth class and came into first year with what seemed like fluent Irish. All I knew from my #InterdenominationalEducation was *Ní raibh scamall sa spéir*, the first line in the solitary textbook I had ever seen, *Bog Liom*. Our secondary school just lobbed all levels in together and I never managed to get up to speed, a problem that was aided by my attitude to the language and my lifelong refusal to work hard on things I'm not interested in. I remember really pissing off my Irish teacher in fifth year because he caught me down the back of the class, reading some novel in French, and soon enough I just dropped to Pass Irish and made it my eighth subject for the Leaving. But in fairness to Nugent, he spoke Irish to us in class, unlike many Irish teachers, and all of our French teachers, which is mental. If you never hear the even bastardized version, you can't just lick it up off the page. I know from 5000 hours of teaching English as a foreign language (and yeah I've counted, and yeah I miss it) that you actually can teach people from scratch, using objects and tasks and body language, and it's a shame that such methods weren't applied in our Irish teaching. I've sent my son to a Gaelscoil, even though I've never developed a real grá for the language, because I feel like it's the least I can do to help the language revive, and there is legiterally nothing to be lost for him.

### James Fitzgerald

![trihub](images/IMG_20231120_152511.jpg)

Helvick Head is less striking than I'd hoped, although the grey clouds hardly draw out the sparkle from the concrete harbour, or even the wide vista across the whole bay, and you'd probably want to walk beyond the cul the sac to see the best of the rock. I fish around in vain for good photos and I'm about to stall on when James Fitz pulls up beside me in a white SUV, delighted that the live location feature on WhatsApp has resolved our Ronde-AV problem. He tells me to double back down to the harbour, where *Solas na Mara* sits, a wellness centre with a cafe, and the place is so clean that I take off my cycling shoes before entering. James is appalled at the hack of me, with my ancient bike and high-viz jacket, and bag on my back, but he's too polite to say anything. Yet. We've never spoken before. Me and Richard were good mates in school and James was two years ahead. But there's always a shared experience there, so it's a wee bit like going on a movie date, except the film was six years long and there's been two decades of aftermath.

The people here know him and it's nice to watch a teeny bit of the tightknit rural community in action. It's something I have always craved. He asks for the physio to come over when he gets a chance and then we sit down with our coffees for some rapid-fire catch up. Richard being Richard, the madzer, running his media empire in the Middle East. William, their younger brother, who works in Silicon Valley, and whom I would have met out there only for Covid lockdown. The physio comes over and James is eager for me to tell all about my lighthouse escapades. It's nice to hear myself presented from a different angle cos you don't want to be always volunteering unsolicited plans to everyone. James tells him about his banjoed knee, how it gave in during the Dublin City Marathon a few weeks back, and he points to his beanie commemorating the event. He was on course for the family record but the knee gave in and Michael, the youngest brother, still holds it at around 3.30 or so. It's beautiful to watch the family rivalry, four brothers and two sisters, pushing each other, whether conscious or not. The last time I had an ongoing sporting rivalry with my five siblings was playing tennis against Maggs when I was thirteen and she was sixteen, although just last week I did come back from the dead and beat my grown-up nephew in bowling; and that felt *extra* good.

It turns out the James has been flogging cars for Brendan Keary who was in my year in school, but he has recently opened a triathlon shop in Youghal. He's only off today cos it's Monday and otherwise I'd've dropped in to him to say hello and check out the gear. He's curious to know exactly what I'm lugging on my needlessly back and as soon as I start explaining he cuts me off because he knows I'll explain it all away. We end up talking about the day-to-day pressures of stocking a shop, and tight profit margins, and how to balance it all against the joyous intensity of child-rearing. I want to ask him about his motivations for doing triathlons because as a child I followed my mam around the country as she swam, cycled and ran her way through what I've always imagined to be unresolved trauma. Her father died when she was six and then she was shipped off to boarding school. The Fitzgeralds had a similar upbringing. But we are either too short on time or I don't know how to ask the questions. What's exciting though, is that James is up for coming on a cycle with me in the new year, and showing me how to do it properly, which I badly need. I'm guessing we'll go from Youghal to Roche's Point lighthouse, on the eastern entrance to Cork Harbour, and maybe look at Ballycotton lighthouse from the land, as there'll be no ferries running til later in the year. It'll be great to get to know him better and re-experience his intensity across the timeframe it deserves.

Before leaving, I ask about getting to Mine Head lighthouse and it turns out that it is on private land, so I'll need permission to get there. This reminds me of the sitch I had in Wicklow Head, and I feel like a Yank out of water, a clueless Jackeen who doesn't understand how life works round here. I can see this on the faces of James and the barista but they tell me I'll be grand. They both of know the family - Paidí and Josephine - and the barista explains that they're the welcoming type. Curious not aggressive. I'll just need to knock and ask. What if they aren't there, I worry. They will be. They're farmers.

###  The lighthouse farmily

![Stad the ball](images/IMG_20231120_104403.jpg)

![Lighthouse position](images/IMG_20231120_104737.jpg)The location of the lighthouse is not obvious from the land, but if you look at a map (inset), you can see the chosen cliff allows

I set off and it's good to be on the road after so much fuckaroundary all morning. It's only like 10k to the lighthouse and I'm there before I know it. The coast around here is a series of protruding cliffs, and the bigger ones have their own road. When I get to my one, I'm met with a sign saying *No access to lighthouse*, but I know to plough on and I stop at the farmer's bungalow. There's no car outside and no one answers the door, but thankfully the collie dog is chill cos dogs and bicycles are like oil and water. I decide to head on inanyways and soon I hear a car behind me. I turn around and wave and cycle back up to him.

![The lighthouse campus and laneway are owned by the Commisioners of Irish Lights, but the road and the surrounding land belong to a cattle farmer. Thus the lighthouse is advertised on local tourist signs and yet you are not supposed to be able to access it. Welcome to Ireland.](images/IMG_20231120_112837.jpg)

The farmer introduces himself as Paíd Morrissey, and his accent reminds me of Seán Kelly even thought he's from 50k away. It just shows how little I know this part of the country. Paíd is as gentle as the collie at the door, a compliment I plámásingly drop, and I tell him that I was just with James. I ask him to tell me a bit about the lighthouse and he starts out in proto-tour-guide mode with a spiel about it being built in 1851 and it being the highest lighthouse in the country, but I can now hold a conversation about a lighthouses so he chillaxes a bit and we just talk for a while. He's not sure why the tower itself is so high \[21m\], given that it's perched on top of a cliff \[63m\] but there's nothing but effin fog around here so maybe the height helps with visibility. The problem is that the records have all been lost as they were burnt in the London Blitz, wudyabelieve. He is sad that he doesn't know who owned the land back then, and I forget to ask him how long the land has been in his family. Like elsewhere, there seems to have been a bit of brouhaha over ownership of the land, although Paíd is too mild-mannered to grouse openly. The lighthouse and grounds belong to the Commissioners of Irish Lights (CIL) but the road is his, but he put his foot down when they wanted to whip out the old Fresnel Lens. Their trump card is the presence of mercury, a substance that may have been the ruination of many's a lighthouse keeper, and I can really feel the tension here between tradition and the bolloxology brigade. We chat a bit about James and his triathlons and he wants to know if I'm as much of a header, and I tell him I'm in it more for the journey than the challenge. I could chat all day to this man but after a few false starts, we part company.

![near side](images/IMG_20231120_114019_1.jpg)

The road down to the lighthouse is as rough and sloppy as on any cattle farm and I probably should walk in case I get a puncture. But it's fun to do a bit of cyclo-cross even though I misjudge one corner and skid into a manure-filled puddle. Luckily I stay upright and plough on as far as the lighthouse campus. There is a red gate, in need of paint, with the now-familiar *CIL* welded into it, and a sizeable wall along the laneway to the lighthouse and around its grounds' perimeter. One of Páid's fields fills the space between the lane and the sheer cliffs below, so I rest the bike against the gate and plod across its sog. I scale the wall at its lowest point and stroll down to the tall tower, with its two vacant cottages, designed for two families, with a neat rectangular plot apiece for growing fruit and veg, as everyone once did, whereas nowadays there'd be a seldom-used trampoline for the kids. The cottages remain vacant but I can see them being rented out to holidaymakers, once the property dispute is resolved between CIL and Paíd. Although I can also just see people living here permanently as it's quite a normal place, bar the massive drop off a cliff on one side.

![Cliffs](images/IMG_20231120_114419-01.jpg)

I'm always amazed at how sturdy lighthouses can be, as shockingly gargantuan in stature as a forward in international rugby. This one is painted black and white like a Barbarian, or a poor man's Hook Head, and the lantern room up top has also been painted white, making it look boarded up, like a business that never reopened after the recession. Some NASA-looking machines sit inside one of the cottages and I assume this provides a control room for the technicians whenever they come along. It'd be nice to join them some time and see what the Jacques Chirac is. I've been reading a book about rock lighthouses (*Seashaken Houses)*, written by an architect, Tom Nancollas, and because they are offshore, he has to head out with the technicians and gets to see inside and how they work. I might just give the CIL a shout and see what they say cos I'm tired of not knowing the deets and I'm sure plenty of you would like to know something about a lighthouse by now. Before leaving, I mosey about the field overlooking the cliff and thankfully there's an electric barb wire fence demarking preventing me from going dangerously close to the edge, cos I'm shit-scared of heights.

![Cycling heaven](images/IMG_20231120_121000.jpg)

It's time to punch on. Not a lot done, much more to do. It's 29k to Youghal and 32 if I go via Ardmore, so I decide to check it out for completion, and Richard Fitz suggested it. By now, it's as mild a day as you'll get in November, twelve or thirteen degrees, with the sun breaking out from the clouds, yet the wind remains fierce and you can see its impact on the echelon-shaped trees which grow in response to the prevailing wind. All day I'm putting on and off my magic gloves. I barely meet a car and I get lost in thought so I must have been in the zone. One day these serene roads will be filled with leisure cyclists and, in preparation for their coming, they have already been marked out as part of the [Euro Velo project](https://en.eurovelo.com/ev1?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAx_GqBhBQEiwAlDNAZglc1iUDslyfMM_zcWtNQniHJJqexVBpuPukR1HnO_xEtlZniXzUdRoCPe8QAvD_BwE), which has the decency to include Wexford, Waterford and East Cork, unlike the Wild Atlantic Way which begins in Kinsale. For now, the tourists remain glued to the West Coast, yet everyone has to compete for space along the few roads that got built along its craggy terrain. Here, where the land is good enough for cattle farming, and oodles of road connect it all up, cycling is perfect, because cars and lorries stay on N25, to the north, while no one comes to this appendix zone. It's a fabulous place but it has the same misfortune as the forgotten second- or third- or even fourth-prettiest sister in a family of stunners. I stop off for a (very) quick dip slash wash in Curragh Bay beach and a pair of passers-by make sure to have a needless dig at me for being in and out so fast. I tell them I was in longer than they were and then sit myself down for a slightly rushed lunch of mangoes, cheese and crackers.

![beach](images/IMG_20231120_130059.jpg)

Time is getting tight now and my trip to pretty little Ardmore turns out to be a bad decision because I could have kept this precious time for Youghal. The village is empty and windy and I don't have time for a warm meal. The main shop closes at 2pm at this time of year and they've turned off their coffee machine in preparation. I pop in to *Garden Kitchen* for a half-decent macchiato, charge my phone for ten minutes and lash down some notes while chatting to a Corktrotting pensioner from Middleton who warns me about the school-collection traffic in Youghal. I'm on the road soon enough though cos it's going to be dark soon and the trip back up to the N25 is into the wind and slightly uphill. I've got 16k to cycle now but it's only seven or eight k as the crow flies. There used to be [a Lee Scratch across the Blackwater from Ferrypoint to Youghal,](http://kinsalebeg.com/chapters/ferrypoint/ferrypoint.html) a swimmable distance from sand spit sticking out into the water, but it was discontinued in the 1960s after seven hundred years of use.

![Youghal from afar](images/IMG_20231120_142401.jpg)

While I have to skip a wee bit of coastline in favour of the main road, entering Youghal from the Waterford side is truly beautiful. The town sits across the wide estuary and the bridging point is a few clicks north of the town. It's good to be in Cork at long last, and I expect to see a lot of it in the coming year(?s). I think back on my travels thus far through counties Waterford, Wexford, Wicklow, Dublin, Meath, Louth and Down which together may have less coastline than jiggly jaggy Cork, with its seventeen active lighthouses and three inactive. Today, however, will have to be a bit of quick hello cos it'll soon be dark and I don't want to be hit by a lorry.

![This sign alerts the visitor, on arrival to the People's Republic of Cork, that while things may be done backwards hereds, they are done with the aplomb required to execute a bicycle kick.](images/IMG_20231120_142925.jpg)

![Cork: Ireland's ancient east](images/IMG_20231120_143443.jpg)

The first thing I see, once over the county border, is a sign indicating Ireland's Ancient East. This bizarre scenario arises because, as noted above, the *Wild Atlantic Way* kicks off in Kinsale, west of Cork City, and the rest of Ireland siply *hadto* have some marketing status. East Cork needed to be put into some category and the gerrymandered solution created problems that never previously existed. Thus Ireland's *Ancient East* loops from East Cork, through Waterford, then all the way along the Lonster Coast, minus Dzublin but plus Monaghan, because the legendary marketing department have long since truncated Ulster into Nair Nairn. The Ancient East used to include the likes of Longford - itself a former county of Connacht - but that has been legitimately recategorized as the *Hidden Heartlands*, which includes inland Connacht, outlaw Leinster, orphaned Cavan, and, the heart of Darkness itself, East Clare. Back at the local level, Youghal is branding itself as some kind of medieval beach town, like something on the Italian coast, with its ancient clock tower on top of the billboard and the sundrenched beach, *dubh le daoine*. I'm just raging I didn't get a snap of it.

![*Youghal appears to be getting regenerated, with this Victorian building being chopped up into apartments alongside the modern building adjacent, although I'm not a hundypee whether that structure is coming or going, and it feels like the whole of Youghal is stuck in that state.*](images/IMG_20231120_144736.jpg)

The town itself is a skinny pair of one-way streets wedged between a cliff and the sea or, technically, a river bank and a very wide estuary, and it's a shallow ascent up to the lighthouse on the far side of the town. As warned, I get held up behind a Bus Eireann school bus and I can't mount the footpath for all the parents, prams and phalanxes of chicken-fillet-munchers. Beyond the town centre, there is space enough for a wodge of large summer houses and hotels overlooking the water. Some of these are Victorian and others Celtic Tigerish but many of them are derelict and it feels like the town would benefit from a blast of global warming, or maybe a train line to Cork so that people could feasibly commute to work and take advantage of all this natural beauty. Some [new apartments](https://ashtoncourt.ie/) are being built alongside a large Victorian house and this suggests the town is a hashtag transitional neighbourhood, so I'd imagine you'd want to be fairly prepped for some early-stage gentrification if you're out there looking for a cheap gaff.

![view from lighthouse](images/IMG_20231120_150945.jpg)

The stubby lighthouse sits right on the main road, with its campus leading, out of sight, down to the water. It's a typical, nineteenth-century lighthouse, designed by the main man himself, George Halpin, but the site has been used to light a flame since the 12th century. I climb up onto an embankment on the other side of the road and sit down for more nosebag, hoping that the council workers below, yapping to each other, don't drag me down. The view from here is fantabulous, with the low sun illuminating the lighthouse and the land across the wide river, but you'd have to stall it round the corner to look out to the Celtic Sea, a task I'll hopefully do on my way to Ballycotton. For now, I need to Rock'n'Ryle Nugent cos it's ten past three and I've got 32 undulating kilometres ahead of me.

![Youghal clock tower](images/IMG_20231120_151424-01.jpg){width="300"}

As I exit Youghal, I spot [several gorgeous old buildings](https://youghal.ie/heritage/built-heritage/) which demonstrate the longevity of this town and, how it may be simply be in a bit of a trough, being without the feasible compass of both Cork (58k) and Waterford (75k) cities. But a surge in airline flight prices would do wonders for the town, along with some clever use of the flatlands north of the town, and the coast to the south. A greenway is being developed along the old train line, which means [the old train line won't be restored,](https://www.echolive.ie/corkviews/arid-41125963.html) but I do hope the surge in cyclists will be of help to James Fitzgerald's new triathlon shop, which I pass by in the industrial gap between the town and the main road. The sun is setting behind me and the autumn colours glisten off the glorious hedgerows. The wind may be on my back but the road keeps rising to meet me, and the return is a long-ass slog, with several uphill drags, steeper in my mind and legs than on paper. The view over Dungarvan is extraordinary from a height and the descent is a welcome finale. I stop off in a petrol station and nail a Fanta, thinking I'm Remco Evenepoel after a breakaway victory, but I still have to eke through to the other side of the town to get to my jammer. My belly is in a jocker and I just want to get home so I don't stay for dinner. The drive home in the dark is shorter than the trip here and I even flirt with stopping off in Kilkenny for a quick goo. But I decide against it and end up hitting the UPFs in Paulstown Service Station, then I'm home to kiss the kids goodnight and catch up on a well-earnt kipafuckinrooney.

![26k doesn't sound like a lot but it sure feels like it when cycling against the gloaming on a wide, undulating road](images/IMG_20231120_152917.jpg)

On the other side of the ride is an embankment with flowers and I climb up and sit down for more nosebag.

I lodge myself on the other side of the road

this feels like a #transitional neighbourhood at best.

**Return leg**

although it's not big enough to be the only connection between the cities of Cork and Waterford

**Dungarvan**

The view over Dungarvan is spectacular but it's cloudy, misty and nearly dark, so I don't bother taking a photo. It reminds me of a smaller Dublin, with a circular bay and a low-lying town where the river meets at the centre. On the far side of the town is a ring of hills and it's obviously elevated here on the Youghal side as I can see over the town, having dragged my knackered body up the long drag. It doesn't take much imagination fill in a bigger town, unlike poor Youghal which is like barnacles stuck to a hill.

Other than that, this just looks like normal Ireland, with lumpy roads and big green fields. Now that I'm cycling properly I have to stop for a change of costume as I'm too warm, so I stuff my blue Regatta jumper back in to the miserable bag on my back whose strings are already starting to pull at my. I really need to get a panier rack on the back of this bike, and then I can lob whatever I need for the day into a panier.

**Richard Fitz**

\- The most soccer-mad kids in a boarding school where you had to fill your time with something.

\- Both of us were Blackburn fans and when one of us was sick we asked the other to come join in the infirmary, which was a thing. It was a refuge from the day-to-day life of school, the only place in the school where you could make toast or sit on your Gordon. Funnily enough, I was up there with nasty asthma, hooked up to a nebuliser, while the eponymous Gordon D'Arcy, in fifth year at the time, was visiting his mate and munching on toast eating toast. I had some kind of panic attack, and D'Arce had to rescue me, which was something I was incredibly proud of. Even in school, D'Arcy was a celebrity, and two years later, he was playing in the rugby World Cup. He actually went a wee bit off the rails for a few years after, just like all of us who spent their teenage years locked up in a boarding school, and the only difference being that he was missing Ireland caps while the rest of us weren't arsed showing up for club matches.

\- it's a reminder of how even with

\- . It's mad that he was famous even back then

\- Innovative, entrepreneurial in a way that I've since lost somehow

-   I'd organise lunchtime football tournaments and fantasy football

-   In Sixth Year, Fitz set up a soccer team for the fourth years and I tagged along for a bit as an assistant coach

-   Later he got into new media stuff. He had this blog called 52 Burrito Dates

I've an old mate from round here called Richard Fitzgerald and I last caught up with him at our twenty-year school reunion last summer. He flew home from Dubai on the Friday, did a half iron man in Youghal on the Saturday morning, and then stalled it up to meet us in Blessington that evening. On the Sunday morning, we loaded his bike in my car and I dropped him off in the airport whence he flew back to Dubai to continue running his media empire. Although in fairness he was running it from his Tony all morning. It was a great chance to chat to an old friend who has built up something and to see how he does it.

He was reading about CEOs and football men when we were fourteen, fifteen.

I never had any interest in business but he managed to see the link and make the transition and even a cursory check online shows him talking about applying football or tennis pressure to your business life.

So I texted Fitz last night to see if he had any suggestions and he sent my his brother James's number. As it happens, he's just opened up a triathlon shop in Youghal and I thought I might catch him there or for coffee but he's off of a Monday and so we work out a plan here in Waterford. I send him my live location and, once the kids are in school, he just pursues me in his Jammer and catches me at Helvick Head, at the southern extremity of Dungarvan Bay.

**We go for coffee in Sólás na Mara, a wellness centre beside the harbour, so clean that I decide to take my cycling shoes off.**

where his physio works and the

you can have massage or seaweed bath. Everyone knows James here and it's nice to see the dynamic. This is something I want for my family.

James is appalled at the hack of me although he's too polite to say anything until we're a good bit into the conversation. He wants to know what's in my bag, the one I'm lugging around on my back. I start explaining myself and he correctly points out that I'm going to have an answer for everything, but really it boils down to why I'm cycling. Our purposes are different. Last week he went out for a hundy k and all he had was like a bottle and a bar. I tell him I"m out for a day's work. I need my phone to take photos for my book. I need a change of clothes so I can swim in God's ocean. But I do need to keep editing my load. I will need my car key at the end of the day, but I don't need the other hundy grams of house keys and key rings. I also need proper warm gear, designed for cyclists.

-   Needs to talk to the physio cos his knee has been banjoed since he did the Dublin City marathon, and he points to his hat from the occasion

-   There's talk of Amsterdam and its flatter course

-   He was on course for the family record until his IT band seized up after 28k and

**Paid Morrissey**

I don't know if he honks at me or I just hear him or what, but I turn around and wave and cycle back up to him. He's as gentle as the collie at the door and I tell him that I was just with James.

He introduces himself as Paid Morrissey

Mine Head Lighthouse

James's daughter and Paid's granddaughter are in naoinra together

Accent is Sean Kelly's

I ask him to tell me a bit about the lighthouse and he starts out in proto-tour-guide mode with a spiel about it being built in 1851 and it being the highest lighthouse in the country, (wording) but I can now hold a conversation about a lighthouses so he chills a bit and we just talk for a while. He's not sure why the tower is so high, given that it's perched on top of a cliff, but there's nothing but fucking fog around here so maybe the height helps. The problem is that the records have all been lost as they were burnt in the London Blitz, wudyabelieve. He is sad that he doesn't know who owned the land back then, and I forget to ask him how long the land has been in his family. Like elsewhere, there seems to have been a bit of brouhaha over ownership of the land, although Paid is too mild-mannered to grouse openly. The lighthouse and grounds belong to the Commissioners of Irish Lights (CIL) but the road is his, and he put his foot down when they wanted to whip out the old Fresnel Lens. Their trump card is the presence of mercury, a substance that may have been the ruin of many's a lighthouse keeper. I didn't catch the exact resolution

The road down is as rough and sloppy as on any cattle farm and I probably should walk in case I get a puncture. But it's fun to do a bit of cyclo-cross even though I misjudge one corner and skid into a manure-filled puddle. Luckily I stay upright and plough on as far as the lighthouse campus. There is a red gate, in need of paint, with CIL welded into it, and a sizeable wall along the laneway to the lighthouse and around its grounds' perimeter. One of Páid's fields fills the space between the lane and the sheer cliffs below, so I rest the bike against the gate and plod across its sog. The wall is lower in one spot so I scale it there and stroll down to the tall.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Mine Head lighthouse**

I'm always amazed at how sturdy lighthouses can be, as shockingly gargantuan in stature as a forward in international rugby. This one is painted black and white like a Barbarian, and set beside it are two cottages, and more thick walls separating them and marking out two plots which were surely used for growing vegetables.

-   Something about the bit where the light is (blocked off, boarded up)

-   Some nice sunlight

-   Can't capture the drop to the sea, but the photo of other cliffs might do

nd thankfully there's an electric barb wire fence demarking the field and preventing me from going dangerously close to the edge.

**Ardmore bound**

Punch on. - Not a lot done, much more to do. It's 29k to Youghal and 32 if I go via Ardmore, so I decide to check it out for completion, and Richard suggested it.

-   It's as mild a day as you'll get in November, twelve or thirteen degrees, with the sun breaking out from the clouds, yet the wind remains fierce and you can see its impact on the echelon-shaped trees which grow in response to the prevailing wind. All day I'm putting on and off my magic gloves.

-   I barely meet a car and I get lost in thought so I must have been in the zone. One day these serene roads will be filled with leisure cyclists and, in preparation for their coming, they have already been marked out as part of the Euro Velo project, which has the decency to include Wexford, Waterford and East Cork, unlike the Wild Atlantic Way. For now, the tourists remain glued to the West Coast, yet everyone has to compete for space along the few roads that got built along its craggy terrain. Here, where the land is good enough for cattle farming, and oodles of road connect it all up, cycling is perfect, because cars and lorries can zoom along the main road (N25), while no one comes to this appendix peninsula.

-   must compete for space along the few roads

-   

-   This part of the country has the same misfortune as the second- or third-prettiest sister in a family of stunners.

-   

-   of being like the second or third best-looking

The next two journeys both involve people I know

I also hate driving in the dark because I have a light sensitivity condition and I can't wear the midnight blue lenses I need to make the world look calm.

**Thanksgiving**

I'm off work for Thanksgiving week so it's a good chance to catch up on some lighthouses.

I actually thought it'd be next Thursday, but it turns out that Thanksgiving is on the fourth Thursday of November (the 23rd) not the last Thursday of November (the 30th), so it's a good thing I didn't book some winter sun in Morocco, like last year, when the chunfla was jumping waves in Taghazout. Instead, he's in school and I've got a big of #metime. **Not sure it's worth including this**

0454, Monday November 20, 2023

Thanksgiving is this Thursday so I'm off work for the week. Now I actually though it'd be next week, cos I assumed Thanksgiving was on the last Thursday of November (the 30th), rather than the fourth Thursday (the 23rd), so I've no holidays booked. Plus we've just gone sale agreed on a gaff in Wicklow Town so there's not much cash floating around for Winter Sun, like last year's cheeky week in Taghazout, Morocco. So anyway, I"m driving to Dungarvan today, 200 clicks away, and then heading west, to - Tiredness

------------------------------------------------------------------------

although I also know that the I'm too delicate to cope with the silent judgment that people from the West

but I'm also so sensitive that I know I'd never be able to cope with the passive-aggressiveness that is built into

which is a weird choice because if Irish were to re-emerge as the lingua franca across the country, then you'd expect there'd be a need to retain the English placenames out of respect for all the poor Saxonites whose language had been lost or marginalised.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

James asks me if I regret leaving the States so abruptly in 2020. I started my current job there, three days before lockdown kicked in, and then we bounced after four months, having met basically no one. It's a frank question and it hits deep because I realise now that I do regret it, even though we were just unlucky that a pandemic coincided with the opportunity of a lifetime - eighteen months of working in Silicon Valley. Only now do I know that I sometimes get anxiety attacks, or something similar, and I freak out and run. In that case I dragged my whole family back across the world. That's kinda why I cycle to lighthouses. I can formalize my need to run away before it takes over. Previously, I probably just went on benders.
