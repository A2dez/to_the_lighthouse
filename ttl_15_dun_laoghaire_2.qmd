To the lighthouse 15: DL2, South Dublin rural loop

0950 December 29, 2023. A Friday I'm told.

It's six degrees and windy in Dublin today, but no rain is expected, at least not in the lowlands, as they're not called. The wind should be on my mostly back, as it's coming from the south-west, as per, and I'm cycling an Eastward semi-circle, the South Dublin Rural route which I've been piecing together for years and reckon I can nail today. You start out on the River Liffey, in town or wherever, and follow it to Chapelizod and Lucan village, along its admittedly North Bank, then cross over and do a full semi-circle around the outskirts of the city, rising slowly through Backweston, Hazelhatch, Newcastle and Sagart, before taking on the Dublin Mountains, stopping off for grub in Johnnie Fox's, Ireland's highest boozer, and then downhill to the coast to cool off in the sea if the descent hasn't already sucked the heat out of your body. Your endpoint could be anywhere in the built-up coastal suburbs of Dun Laoghaire, Dalkey, Killiney, although there is probably a rural(ish) path to Shankill, an area I don't know well yet. The only rule is that you have to stay in County Dublin throughout, a county whose underappreciated beauty is a hill I'm willing to die on, although in planning it out (for once), I was unable to dodge a few hundred metres of spillover into County Kildare because the growth of Adamstown has necessitated it.

In my case, the endpoint will be Dun Laoghaire East Pier, a lighthouse which I have been saving up until I have the right moment. And that's today. It's the Perineum Week, the gap between Xmo and New Years, and I'm ready to get out of the Roisin while the family are happy to chillax at home. I'm not ready early cos I like to look after the bambino in the morning while my sleep-deprived wife catches up on kip, so it's nearly 10 o'clock agin I'm on the Dermot. I had planned to go on a smallish spin with Arthur but he ended up on the lash with his new bird, so it's just me, myself and the Falcon. I lash on a body warmer, a cycling jersey, a windbreaker and one of about seven orange bibs I've been guiltily hanging on to ever since I quit Cabra football. Downstairs, I've got long johns on with cycling shorts over them, the wrong socks and my cleated cycling shoes. I pack minimally, with just a spare jersey in my back pocket and a wifebeater scarfing around my neck, to double up as an undergarment on the train home. For sustenance, I grab an apple, an avomikado, three small nartenges, some salted peanuts and some Spin 103.8s I got for my delighted wife in the Halal shop last night. She lobs some vitamins into my water bottle and gives me a fibre sachet too along with a coke-bag of spirulina. The bike has a slow-release puncture, but I reckon I'll be grand cos I pumped it up before bed and it barely flattened overnight, so I give it a quick blast and say my prayers. I need to buy a new mini-pump.

The weather is middlingly miserable, with a twenty kph cross-headwind on my way to Lucan. Six Degrees Celsius is also not a fail. I've discovered that temperature in Fahrenheit matches exactly against University grades.

40°F = 4.5°C, a third class degree, the barest of passes. Wear your coat and optional gloves.

50°F = 10°C, a Desmond Tutu. A bit crap but acceptable. Wear a jumper

60°F = 16\*C, a II.1. A good degree. Wear a t-shirt

70°F = 22°C, a first class degree. Do as you please.

but I feel well wrapped up and my thermal gloves complete the job. There's a cross-headwind but that won't be for long.

This is a home fixture for me, at long last, but it's funny to stop and take photos of familiar sites.

Blanch

\- Canal greenway

\- Diswellstown

\- Rugged Lane entrance

\- Paved now

\- Backed up on the Strawberry beds

\- People think that Blanch is near Lucan but it's actually 10k across a steep river valley

\- Or else across the M50

 - Pay six nicker for the #privilege of dropping dinner over to my folks

\- Lucan village

 - Weir, near flooded

 - Fella there who says it burst a while back, up towards the apartments

 - We reminisce on the flood of I think 1992 when the Griffeen burst and flooded Kenneys and O'Neill's pubs. He was in there that morning and I ask him if he was still going or getting started and he says he was in for a cure

 - That day was one of the happiest memories of my childhood as me and my dad went for a walk together to scope out the other flood point, near the entrance to the Demesne, where the NAME RIVER converges with the Liffey.

 - In my memory, it was Saturday June 16, 1992, and Sports Day in school was cancelled, so we all came home from Boarding School for Half Term \[it was actually 1993\]. Me and Big Val brought a disposable camera, which was something you only did when you want on like holidays, and I remember being distraught when they didn't develop properly.

 - I point out that it's a pity this chunk of river is set off from the village but your man reminds that me the council has bought the land off the Italian Embo so we'll be able to walk through it and connect up with the Lucan demesne and on up to Leixlip. This, I point out, will be an important step towards putting in a #greenway all the way in to town, and my brother-in-law only suggest the other day that Shackleton's mills might be restored as a tourist spot, given how darn famous Ernest Shackleton is. Your man makes the point that there should be space enough for a big car park in the Embassy grounds and that will take a lot of the misery out of the village, which is beautiful but nothing like as well-used as it could be.

 - It's nice to talk Lucan for once.

 - I grab a jar of jam for my folks from a regular street vendor outside the Protestant Church


- Hub by the BP

\- I can hear Yo la Tango singing My little corner of the world

\- Dad's shop to the left

 - Avoid cos the main road is so shite

 - Also I have come to think that this junction is a natural

Drop in to my folks.

I haven't brought my 300g of needlessly keys so I have to knock on the sitting-room window where Big Val is having his mid-morning doze. He jolts in his medical chair and then hobbles to the door with his stick and lets me in. He says my mother has gone out for a break and he laughs and he's delighted I've brought the marmalade. He has a fierce sweet tooth and my mam is stickler for food so you nearly need to smuggle it in. I tell him I don't have time to stay and I legiterally don't yet it's curiously offensive to not have a quick cup of tea. Even to me. I don't like rushing in his presence because he won't be around for long and he's just such good craic. Looking after him is not a chore but constant laughter. But his memory for names is not sharp. I explain today's route to him, all places he would have cycled around for about twenty adult years, and he's struggling to piece the it together, but he laughs when I mention that Slade Valley is on top of a hill. He can't remember the name of the carer who was just in doing his exercises with him, though it was the good one, who goes the extra mile, not like the ones who just do what they have to. But he remembers she's from up near Tesco (Dodsboro, unnamed) where the fella (unnamed) is from who my eldest sister (name remembered) married (actually they were just engaged...). This narrows it down to two carers so I ask if she was a young wan. Of course that's a shite question cos when you are nearly 89, everyone is a young wan. So I ask if she was 25 or 45 and, bursting into laughter, he says 35. I hit the road and leave him back to the empty day ahead, although he'll be glad of it now after six family events in the last five days.

\- As I'm leaving, he asks for my wife, whom he loves dearly, but he can't think of her admittedly strange name.

\- My mam is out for her much-needed morning ramble.

\- He lives in the moment, unconcerned for the past or future, like an accidental Buddhist monk

I remember when it was all just fields

Tubber Lane

\- Covid lockdowns

\- Trips with the baby on the bike,

\- Photos before it's all gone

\- Cillian Ryan lives here

 - Laundry went missing

 - Probably a legit mistake dbf,

 - But he was somehow wearing my same lime and navy t-shirt some time later

\- Aderrig Parish

 - Remember when I

\- Back roads

\- Arthur's Way

\- Dog on the corner, running after me every day

\- Think of the fella who cycled from Ireland to Japan and the scariest part were packs of dogs in Romania or Bulgaria

\- Train view

 - Can see the little known hills of NorthEast Kildare

 - Hazelhatch McEvoys

 - Boat people

 - Seems lime more than there used to be

\- Danny Janssens

 - Niece married to my mate's brother, the sort of rural interconnection that I've never really had

 - The pleasantness but not of the nastiness of the Irish (?farmer?)

 - Belgian planter

 - Sense of humour 5% off

 - Compare Al Nolan

 - N

\- Newcastle finally being filled up

 - Everywhere gets it eventually

 - This whole cycle will be impossible in a few years' time

\- Dad's shop

 - Babs, zig&zag, Trish

 - Dick Smith,

 - Watched the solar eclipse with him in summer of 1999 squinting through a broken piece of welder's glass

 - House opposite knocked down

 - Rumour was that the priest lived there with a housekeeper locked upstairs

\- Newcastle Rathcoole Gap

 - Filled with industrial estate slash business park shite

\- Texaco

 - Lar Harney, Mary's brother, would go in, wearing odd wellies, and stinking of cattle shite and kids would run away from him.

 - Meanwhile, Dora, and early adopter of high-end stuff like sandwich delis, battled hard to keep the place clean and I still hear her scolding voice in my head every time I want to park my bike against glass.

\- Left for Sagart

 - Coffee

 - Regular stop for me here

Slade Valley

\- Top of a hill

People often wonder what comedy will be like in a post-woke world, but Big Val has long since nailed it, as his humour is based around absurdity and impossibility. The only time it ever went wrong was when my mam was doing a raffle and a possibly deceased artist donated a painting. The daughter called soon after and asked how much it fetched and my dad jokingly said a million quid. The problem was that the daughter had been waiting a long time for this day to come and so my dad felt McGotes Orkwo, something that never happens to him.

His personality ought to be captured through actual speech, not explanation-y stuff

\*\*\*

There are a few hundred metres in Kildare which I couldn't avoid

somewhere on the coast where you can cool off with a swim if the descent

before descending to the coast

for a swim in whichever part of the South Dublin North Wicklow coast line that which ever part of the SDNW coastline you like,

\- This is clearly how the lads in the Giro felt every day this year in the wind and rain and cold for three weeks solid.

Stop on the road to Johnny Fox's
- cyclists asks if i'm ok and he probably realises I'm worse than I realise (wording)

\- i say i'm just wrecked

\- but i realise after i must be dehydrated, although later on my wife suggests I might have mild hypothermia. I

\- the next 8k are heavy going but

\*\*\*

I stop for peanuts and a date and I could do with more but I punch on. I'm nearly out of water now too which is a worry.

\- It's too rainy for people to stop and talk and anyhow they all seem to be the self-loving city types who don't engage with strangers.

\-

Glenasmole

\- The climb up to the Military Road undulates and it's hard for me to get a rhythm, especially with my tiny range of gears (explain). These old bikes weren't designed for rampas r

\- Some parts are fine but some ramps are 14% for a few hundred metres and it's not easy to drag 93kg up there and while zigzagging helps, the roads are so narrow that it's hard to do

\- I was up here with Kilroy early in the summer and he nailed it straight off while Blue Thunder's gearing broke several times so I had to dismount and fix it.

\- When I get to the top of the wall, car stops to let me pass and as I signal, he gives me a little clap and I break into a huge smile which gets me through the next few hundred metres, yet the climb just keeps on frigging going.

\- I have to go deep but again the lack of rhythm means I can't find it. I remember previous pains like nasty training or the horror of suicide when people can't keep going and that urges me to push on, and then I find some horror in my own family life that gives me that last push. That's my well and that last set of circumstances is added to the pile that I can refer back tot he next time. 


\- At the top, the road is frighteningly windy, like don't go cycling windy, but my only choice would be to descend from whence I came and not complete today's journey. So I punch on and the cold is in me now. I stop off a the viewpoint and take a quick snap of the city below, and I descend further towards the veer-right to Johnny Fox's. I've always loved this valley cos you are up the mountains but not climbing so it's rewarding and beatiful without being agonisingly difficult.

\- I stop for food

\- Yer man etc.

\*\*\*\*

Johnny Fox's

\- i get in and order a pint, a coffee, some water and crisps. I badly need a meal but I don't have time with the light fading. Luckily people vacate the big table by the fire so I set up camp, and hang my windbreaker and shoes on the grill to dry out, then I put my back to the fire, angled slightly towards three ladies having the lolz cos I don't want to ruin their chats with my misery.

\- The place is too busy to be a refuge but it works because squashing people in tightly provides a good substitute for atmosphere. EXPLAIN

\- I'm in no state for joining anyone's conversation, nor to soak up minor variations among the tourists, bar the Yank Boomers out front, talking about the joys of massive rental yields, par example.

\- I ping a lads' group on WhatsApp to see if anyone is round for a pint in an hour and I get one biter so that gives me (?)solace.

\- Reminder of Black Tuesday in Maam's Cross and you appreciate the comforts of a house. Me and Jasper joined Leonard, Mary and Morto who were yomping across Ireland from Dzublin to Galway and on to Achill Island. We teamed up on the bleak side of Galway, setting of from an outhouse beyond Oughterard and decided to cut across country to Maam's Cross.

\- It was June 2006 and it had been raining for two months. The first couple of miles were through a forest and it was mellow enough to play talking games, and then we hit open country, where the Western Way was marked with wooden pillars and a sign saying the Way was closed. Arrogantly, we marched on, and nine hours later we had covered the nine miles of rocky, wet, exposed terrain, and we sat in the boozer for tea. We still had to walk another thirteen miles on the road to Leenane, where Leonard and Mary treated themselves to a B&B while me, Jasper and Morto had to pitch a tent inside one of those green deserts made of conifer trees.

\- I learnt that day that the West of Ireland is best experienced behind a window, either in a house or a car.

\- I leave Sharifa a voice message as soon as I step out of Johnny Fox's but it's a bad idea cos the cold and pain are hitting my body as I speak. On the tricky descent, I see Killiney Hill and Howth Head at once and it's a siblingship I hadn't seen or at least noticed before, two humps marking the boundaries of Dublin Bay. I chicane through Kilternan and then down the bendless shallow descent of Ballycorus Road and the pint in my system makes me feel nineteen again, unfrightened and at ease with myself and the bike. The road from the N11 rising to Killiney Roundabout is as good a set up as you'll get on a bike lane in this country, and then I discover a bike lane hidden behind the trees on the road down to Glenageary-Dun Laoghaire (check). It's a good thing cos it's getting dark now.

\- I'm tempted to sit down for food and a pint now cos your man should be here by now, but I decide to nip down to the lighthouse first and tick that box. This turns out to be a good decision cos it's actually a 3k spin from the Dart Station to the end of the East Pier, past a boatload of sailing clubs. I ask a lady if you can traverse the pier and she says 'not on a bicycle' in the scornful manner typical of passremarkable Irish mothers. There are quite a few walkers out and some unleashed dogs convert it into a slalom course. There are two levels to the pier so the lower one - maybe seven metres wide - is slightly sheltered.

\- The lighthouse is a lot more beautiful than I had expected, its classy stone (CHECK TYPE) complementing its beautiful green glow in the last of the gloaming. Dun Laoghaire looks resplendent with its tall church tower and town lights, while the mountains and clouds behind harmonise in shape as is their wont.

\- I cycle back into the fierce breezed but I'm feeling good now. I check my messages and it turns out that your man had been replying to a different pint request so I'm back on my Tobes now. I want to get some pub grub and a pint but I've no recommendations so I end up going in and out of several boozers hoping to hit the jackpot. In the end I have to a have a scabbyass chicken burger in the appropriately Lighthouse Bar, which tries to be all things to everyone, except for scabby people who don't want to pay an extra 5.50 for some skinny chips with their 12.50 haf

\- Afterwards, I stall it back to Dunphy's for two swift ones at the bar and I hear all about Johnny from Ballybrack's dogwalking schedule, then I'm back on the Boola Dart where the ticket inspector has kindly stored my bike. In my carriage, there's a horrendufied young wan from Donaghmadourravit, screaming into her Tony about being left all alone in Dun Laoghaire and how she's not responsible for what her little brother does to the people who left here stranded. Thankfully the Maynooth train is delayed so I can jump straight onto it and home by eight where my wife has cooked some roast beef and mash, and gives me a blanket to warm the fuck up.
