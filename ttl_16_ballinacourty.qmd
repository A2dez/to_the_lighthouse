0845, Sunday February 4, 2024

I got in to Dunmore East at 9ish last night but Graham and Sophie eat like Spaniards so we tucked in to some needless vino and, as if in a postmodern novel, veggie burgers from Graham's own home delivery range, *Halfway There*. After that, we started to plan out our route on Google Maps, which was worryingly intransigent. We are going to Ballinacourty Lighthouse, on the eastern side of Dungarvan Bay, the one I leapfrogged on my way to Mine Head and Youghal, cos I was saving it for this trip with Graham. From his gaff, it's at least a 110k return journey, back and forth along the hilly coast road cliffs, whereas Google Maps is insisting we take a longer flatter inland route along the famous Waterford Greenway. 130 clicks is too far in the Irish winter, so we decide to drive both of our cars to Tramore, home of multiple lightless lighthouses, then hug the coast all the way towards Dungarvan and check out some of the #greenway on the way back. This means skipping a wee bit of coastline but you can't win 'em all. Sophie is also on call in case it gets too dark to cycle the 90 odd clicks we pencil in.

Our exit strat is a step up from our last trip but the timing coincides with the kids' morning routine so Graham changes their nappies and has a cheeky bit of horseplay with his bambino, while his toddler settles down for her Peppa fix. I faff about prepping my pared down cycling bag, engaging in some low-key pressuremongering, and we're out of there by 845. It's only fifteen bogger minutes to Tramore, plus a needless pit stop for Graham to grab a can of unannounced cola.

We park at the top of the popular sandspit strand and, on either arm of the bay, you can see a set of lightless columns. These were erected in 1826 after the Seahorse wreck of 1816, where almost four hundred people lost their lives in Tramore Bay, and two hundred more elsewhere that same night. On top of the eastern slash righthand headland is the Metal Man, a dude waving from above the cliff, helping to distinguish this bay from Waterford Harbour, nearby to the east. Lighthouse Pete told me about this monument last week. He's been writing a blog about Irish lighthouses since the mid-noughties and I met him for a scoop during the week. Unsurprisingly, we had lots to chat about and, like me, he could talk for Ireland.

A self-confessed anorak of the kind

*e don't bring any food so we'll have to load up route, and while that's a scoobydoobious approach, it's the kind of L you just take when you're in someone else's Roisin.*

*, but Graham elects to take an unlikely left into what seems to be someone's gaff and, confused, I don't, so I pull over on the side of the road and stall on for a bit. He doesn't come back or answer his Tony so I just push on, thinking he musta taken some secret passage known only to locals. It turns out he was in getting a can of coke and*

he catches up with me in Tramore where we park along the strand, with the Metal Man in view to the right slash west and Brownstown Towers to the left slash east.

These lightless towers were built in 1826 in response to the horrific Tramore Bay disaster in which 612 people died across three shipwrecks, the most famous being the Seahorse.

Tramore is famous for its long strand which cuts almost entirely across the wide Tramore Bay. This gentle sand spit is really just a small reprieve from the cliffs that begin in Dunmore and travel westwards all the way along the Waterford coast. Curiously, there are lightless towers on the cliffs on both of the bay's headlands. The the east slash left, are the Brownstown Head Towers, which I've only gone and missed, and to the west slash right is the Metal Man, a maritime scarecrow sitting atop one of three towers. These were built in 1823 in response to the horrendous Tramore

It's a pissy grey day and I've been too scared to look again at the forecast, a luxury I can half-afford as I've got my shit to-prettymuch-gether, gearwise, after the frozation disaster the last day. I finally stalled it over to Decathlon where I was kitted out by a helpful chunfla called Hugh whose dad was a pro, Paul Butler. I'm wearing a skintight bodywarmer base layer with chest padding, which is the permanent version of shoving a newspaper down your jersey, and a wine-colored outer coat which looks like the red leather jacket I picked up in actual Dalston during the peak recession, peak Dickhead era. Before hipsters were even known as hipsters? I've actually lashed my yellow jersey on top for visibility, maximising the Italo disco slash gaybar vibe, but the whole look is ruined by my shoddy dark windbreaker. Meanwhile, Graham is making do with a bright yellow sailing jacket which protects him from the external elements but exposes him to the internal ones.

Lighthouse Pete told me to check out the Metal Man in Tramore because, as a lighthouse with no light, it brings a little variation to the genre. I met him for a Britney in Clonee the other day, partly because I've been meaning to for ages and partly because I now need his help in planning out the more complex trips along the Atlantic islands. He's a self-confessed anorak who has now spent longer blogging about Irish lighthouses than he spent going to punk gigs in his youth, and he gave me a copy of his oddly charming book about fatalities in and around Irish lighthouses between like 1750 and 1920. He's tapped into the fact that lighthouses provide a direct connection to how life used to be in the rare aul times. Maybe It's just me, but I find it much easier to imagine a child falling off a cliff by a lighthouse than to imagine the poor sods dying of dyssentery in the tenements.

The thing about cycling gear is that when you do go for it, you can go big, so if you look like you're ready for a night of Italo disco in a Hi-NRG gay bar, then you just gotta own dressed for a gay bar had during my peak recession, peak*

To the metal man glorious swimming spots one for the hardcore swimmer who dive in off the rocks and another round the corner for casual bathers. A lovely tiny cove that would be a great spot for a rave.

## Farm coast

The coast road from Tramore to Annestown is great cycling country but the coast road is actually through a buncha farms, not along the sea, a problem that arises from the shape of the coastline ï»¿Plenty of steep hills though

Good chats around here less need to stop talking about Marketing etc.

PHOTO square farmland

The arrival into Annestown is spectacular. A little valley of fields morphs into the strand with a lake and possibly marsh area around it. The tiny village sits on a very steep hill, guarded at its base by a pleasingly conspicuous pink house. Graham takes a quick detour left - unannounced of course - to check out the beach where a few shrieking bathers are probably washing away their Bank Holiday excesses.

## Copper Mines

The Copper Coast takes its name from the copper mines which used to be here, between 1824 and 1875. The main 'engine house' survives in ruins while a "freestanding rubble stone chimney" distinguishes the site from any normal ruin. An explanation of the houses inner workings has been provided with an intriguing level of technical detail, where the writer - clearly a civil engineer - has not underestimated their audience. With my emphasis added, they write:

"This building is a winding engine house *{whatever that is}*. It houses a steam engine which pulled materials up and down the mine shafts. The design of the internally mounted beam enginewas basically the same as that of a pumping engine *{which you'll no doubt be familiar with}*, other than the reciprocating motion {*did we cover that in Leaving Cert physics?*} converted into a circular motion through the connecting rod (H) and internally mounted flywheel (L).

**This needs work.**

It's time for some scran

We stop off for coffee in Gourmet House cafe,

Coffee's not Graham's cup of tea so he orders the latter and we ogle the delicioso cakes. His belly screams less than mine so he orders a carrot cake, while I'm trying to work out how to hashtag get the protes in, but the only nutty offer has peanuts and honey, a combo I maxed out on as a sprog, so I choose a homemade bounty bar, which is deloosh, and we get some Fulfil bars for sustenance.

The friendly lady behind the counter asks about our accents, which is easy for me although Graham keeps his gob shut. We tell her we're checking out the coast for the Doris. She goes straight into tour guide mode, extolling the virtues of coastal living and I'm just there, thinking, "Yeahno, nono, no I know like", cos she's preaching to the converted and I'll be moving to Wickla any week now, with sea views in the morning and saltwater air in my lungs, once the solicitors bother their Gordons to push their pencils in harmony.

There's a photo on the wall of the copper mines, with prospectors dressed in splendid white and knackered miners in the shadows, the lot of them united by their over-the-top moustaches. It doesn't look like a scene from the Island of Ireland, and I ask Orla where they all lived, because the info board said there was up to 2000 of the beggars at one point and yet there's no sign of their presence. She said they lived in a shanty town and all that survives are some houses for the prosperous, a group she seems to identify with.

Yet she tells us of the hardship of the people's lives and of one poor lady during the famine who walked here from West Cork, fully two hundred miles away, to meet her husband. On the way, she lost three or four of their children to hunger, and on arrival she found him dead. After that she lost her mind. I tell her of my own mam's troubles, when she had her first bout of mania after cycling through Northern Spain on her Tobler, shortly after her own mother died, and now Orla is telling us of her grief for her father who died last year. We are in the depths of it now and Graham tells us about the shock of his father's death, and how long it took for him to recover. It's not the time to mention that my dad's nickname is Lazarus but I do feel deeply thankful he is back well again - ish, like.

Orla helps us plan out our route to Dungarvan via the famous Waterford Greenway, but she has us doing too much of a doublebackarooney, so we turn left for Stradbally up a steep exit hill, at the top of which is a chunfla having a giggle at the hack of us. It's lumpy terrain and it's not long before we nod our hellos to a farmer who does that delayed second reaction thing comedians talk about. First he nods a perfunctory hello and a moment later he has the same smirk as the chunfla, knowing better than to cycle around this terrain. It's quite the theme of the day because all of the towns and villages sit in the cracks between the endless cliffs. We had it exiting Tramore - *fair play to you for getting up that hill, lads* - and also a smartarse comment from a fellow cyclist in Annestown, whizzing downhill as we huffed uphill. Graham realises he also hears it in Dunmore, where climbing the hill on foot is seen as an achievement in itself, with a much-needed Battle Cruiser on top.

**Stradbally**

Out of Ballyvoo?? cove, don't bother with Stradbally village and the supposably coast road is now a lush thin valley that screams Protestant Estate. Sure enough the Big House pops up and the entrance gate is a thing of beauty, although I wouldn't be surprised if the place has been flogged off to some Continental magnate with zero relationship to the community.

*walk here from West Cork during the famiine to meet with her husband,*

*200 miles from West Cork during the Famine, starting out with her seven children, all of them dying en rout*

*I ask where they all lived, because*

*Orla tells us tyey*

*lady in tourguide automode took a while to shift her to real when talking abouth er own father, her grief, died last year*

*Mutual Masturbation*

*logrolling? she tells me to send on some stuff that she'll post it on Instagram and of course I'll be doing the same, putting a word in for the cafe, and it's the first bit of mutual marketing (masturbation) that I've been involved in, an insight into the bigeachotheruppery that feeds so much #content on the Jimi Internet. I'll wank your sack if you wank mine Afterwards, Graham tells me a bit about his own efforts to employ #influencers to promote his nosebag and the difficulty of getting converting people who land on your website WORDING his issues are the kind of thing I could do with some practice with, as a data analyst in search of work*

**Greenway**

Amateur vibe, which is great, if that's what you're into, but coming off the road makes it seem aggressively pleasant, like California. Families are out in force, couples, joggers, dogwalkers, and the odd Italo Disco fan whizzes by. One young lady looks like she has been re-animated from a photo on Instagram. And one couple give off a whiff of perfume, which is a first on the bike for me.

Beware of the dog.

*It won't be long before the level of and if you ever want to Beware of the dog then this is the place to do it.*

It won't be long before they have to introduce updated road markings to help everyone negotiate the route, and the staggered red gates are a valid first approximation at solving the problem of slowing down cyclists at the many crossroads, although unleashed dogs remain an issue as they simply do not understand how bicycles move.

ï»¿The cycleway itself follows an old trainline and it is as unimaginative as any motorway. For the most part it is just a narrow tarmac road with hedges on either side, and the beauty only comes along the bridges which cross the gorgeous valleys below. I am reminded why I much prefer cycling around back roads than walking through parks, because back roads follow the natural topography of the land, albeit with input layer of farm ownership on top, often forcing road users into horrenjus looparooneys. b results in a one-ness with the landscape that is seldom recreated from the simple geometric drawings upon which parks are built. The road around Ballyvooney Cove follows the path described by a half-eaten Pringle, better known as a truncated hyperbolic paraboloid, a shape you'll see on the roof of modern sports stadia. https://londonist.com/2015/07/anyoneforpringles Nobody would design a cycle path in this shape, but generations of goats and farmers and swimmers and anyone who wanted to pass through here have hacked out a ridonculous but necessary path which brought me great joy.

*Nobody would design a cycle path in the shape of a truncated hyperbolic paraboloid - that's a half-eaten Pringle - and yet that's the shape the road must follow around Ballyvooney Cove, because God made it thus.*

*s a reminder that the organic emergence of back roads, following the natural topography of the land, is so much more beautiful than I don't always like parks because their simple geometry highlights usually*

**Lighthouse**

We get to Clonea Beach, where two daytripper continentals are out posing for their camera, and another sits on the beach. The lighthouse is not visible from here, despite what I read on Lighthouse Pete's blog, but maybe the tide needs to be out. The lone lady leaves and we ask her about accessing the lighthouse. She says it's down the laneway parallel to the golf course, but on private land. It turns out there was another lighthouse enthusiast here recently, a nurse from Ballycotton apparently, who was asking the exact same thing. The lighthouse sits next to a private house with a jeep outside, but everything is plonked together at one end of a huge snooker-table lawn, like furniture waiting to be put back in place after the floor has been mopped. We head straight to the lighthouse but this leaves us within doorbell-pressing distance of the house, so I knock just in case the owner is there, as I'd rather be a polite pothole than a silent trespasser. Plus they might divulge some juicy lighthouse goss if we massage them nicely, but there is no answer. There's not really much we can do with the lighthouse from here, short of patting it its back for being a good lighthouse, so we climb up on a short wall for some photos to mark the occasion, before stalling off for lunch in the golf club hotel around the corner.

The Gold Coast Hotel Bar is jambots but it's not clear whether that's because of the new Bank Holiday or just general Sunday Carvery vibes, with families, pensioners, some couples and even a few #lads looking to maximise their calorie to cash ratio. Normal basically people who want to eat in public without the cost or stress of being in a poncy-ass restaurant, which is almost all of them nowadays. I don't understand why there aren't eateries like this on every street corner or in every estate or apartment complex. When I studied in Edinburgh Uni, we'd stall over to the Mosque kitchen, sit down on canopied benches and smash a curry for a fiver - back when that was a functional unit of currency. You could just make one or two hotpots every day and flog it for an affordable price - say eight nicker a portion - while the kids run around entertaining each other, and you eat with your fellow locals. Instead, every household slaves away on their respective Toblers, shopping, cooking and cleaning for every single dinner, while the kids zone out on their lonely screens. It breaks my heart.

Ideally we'd be sitting by the window overlooking the entire bay but we're in the back, watching punters queue for their Joey Carvery. The the spuds and veg are as bland as in any carvo but the leg of lamb is deloosh and Graham is happy out with his basically Chineser. I grab a Britney from the bar and the barman is wondering if I'm part of the ten-mile run that was on in Dungarvan earlier on, presumably part of the new Bank Holiday weekend. No one seems to know what to be doing with a spare Monday in February, although the runners clearly know that attack is the best form of defence in the Irish winterspring. As we eat, I'm lashing down my notes and it's a bit of a scramble because darkness will fall on the way home and every minute will count now. Plus it's just a hoss for everyone when one person is having their Sunday roast on their day off while you are furiously doing your job at the same time. This imbalance is less obvious on the bike cos we both have to cover the distance. It's like I'm playing chess-boxing but Graham's just boxing.
