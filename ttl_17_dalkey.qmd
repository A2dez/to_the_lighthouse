**Research** - wicklow greenway.

6am ish

It's a Brendan Doris and I'm sat here on my Gordon waiting for the morning deluge to piss off

**pass before facing into a day of intermittent pissing.**

I'm thinking about the Lonster players who yesterday lost their third Champions Cup Final in a Stephen Rea. Ciaran Frawley missed a late drop-at-goal by another cunthair, ...

ADD NOTES

It's to piss intermittently

I've waited until the worst of the rain has cleared and then

### route

I still haven't made it to the little island lighthouse off Dalkey Island and there's also a chunk of coastline between there and Wicklow which I haven't cycled as part of this project, so I decide to just get it done while I have a chance.

My aim is to cycle as much of the coast between here and Bray and then head on towards Dalkey where I may or may not be able to catch a ferry to Dalkey island and get a closer to the lighthouse on the tiny Muggins.

I haven't been out for months and for two reasons.

-   One is that a lot of life has happened -

    -   moving, Badria, unemployment & the difficulty of managing time

-   the other is the raw distances. i need to be properly away

Yesterday was the day to do it EXPLAIN LEINSTER

### View

One of the best views in the Greater Lonster Region can be found in a classic-era council estate called Ocean View, hanging out the back of Wicklow Town, and from there you can see the entire north-eastern quadrant of the county. The estate is up the top of the punishingly steep hill - the Mur de Wicklow I like to call it - and the location was presumably chosen to up keep the #riffraff at arm's reach back when the town's population was smaller and #CoastalLiving an oddball's choice. Nowadays this kind of primo frontage would be snapped up, with the steep field below being sculpted into a park and viewing gallery. Instead a grey horse grazes in peace while its foal runs away at the sight of me and my steed. There's an oldskool shopeen and the litter outside takes me back to the more feckless nation I grew up in. This place is a live museum and shows, as the old maxim goes, how a culture's past survives through its poor. Horseboxes, trailers, and evidence of manual labour, often incomplete, in the sloping front gardens.

Some benches gaze at the outstanding views and I sit down to soak it up. On a normal day, you can see Bray Head and the two Sugar Loaves, their triangular peaks putting some definition on the irregular westward rise up to the larger, smoother mountains with whom I plan on acquainting myself deeply over the rest of my life. At sunset, from this vantage point, their smooth tops bubble out of the ground, each one luring me to visit. On a clear day, you can see beyond Bray to Howth and, I think, Lambay, but it's too grey and gloomy today to resolve much more than the contrast between land and water. The shinty-stick shape of Wicklow Bay is intelligible, arcing north from the port before careering off to Newcastle along several straight kilometres of gravel beach. A thin strip of barely inhabited deposition called the Murrough, along which I'll be trying to cycle, provides some unusually flat land for this hilly county. Inside it is the colonic Broad Lough which is filled twice: in from the west by the River Vartry, whose natural path to the sea has been clogged up; and in through the out door of the short fast River Leitrim estuary whose path has been rectified by the quays leading into the port.

I roll down to the harbour where a handful of motorists have parked up and are now yapping and stripping before their daily ablution. A concrete promenade follows the coast northwards for a click, with a layer of boulders protecting it from the mostly benign Irish Sea, aka Lake Leinster. When I first came here I saw sea living and condo potensh where warehouses rot. Now I see dole offices and a laggard town like a cushion in need of plumping. But that's what happens when you're on the scratch and not sure of your next step in life. The problem with Wicklow Town, with its mutant turtleback hills, is that the landscape is just not quite beautiful enough to pull off the degenerate chic look and it needs some sculpting to show off its features. But change is agonisingly slow in this country and I remember the long slog of living in Dublin 8 as the recession unravelled and my life progressed, from raver to researcher to parent, faster than the gentrification I was craving.

At the railway bridge the concrete gives way to gravel and then it's just a track in the grass pounded out by dogwalkers, while the stoney beach and solitary train track parallel along for miles, as far as the subtle turn in the coast at Newcastle where a small airport and abandoned train station lie. A lighthouse or monument would look great there, a come hither column to attract the eye and mark the end of the bay, where the hills finally complete their shallow descent to the sea. It must be ten k from here to there. I can't tell land distances by sight, but I know it's that far along the so-called coast-road from Rathnew to Newcastle.

My problem is that I just don't know how traversible this track will be. I've cycled about 5k of it before but couldn't find a viable exit road as the lake is in the way and the gates at the level crossings have shiny new locks on them. So I had to take the L and double back on myself. But I'm determined to get through this time. I looked on Strava's heatmap to see if the track was in frequent use and there was a faint line suggesting a small bit of use. Pat the Artist also said he'd followed the coastline at some point but it was dark and the deets are sketchy. He's a retired postman who buzzes about on his foldable bike, photographing ships and painting murals on the pier, and he's great value. I often catch him down by the harbour, and he'll tell you about the reflection of the light in the water and the role of the breeze and the tide. I quiz him about nautical matters and I think of him as a role model. Out there and alive, working hard, not imprisoned by the grunt of working for the man. But he has put in his hours for An Post, and I too must find a way to pay the mortgage while trying to generate something to write about and the time and space to do it.

I cycle the grass and in choosing my route I'm balancing two options. Wider, grassier, slower chunks or thin quick rivets which will dismount me if I make any sideways movement. I choose a mix but eventually the path narrows to a few inches and the wet grass is getting longer. It's wiping against my now hiking boots, footwear I've chosen for today's hybrid terrain, and my foot is getting wet. Bit early for that. I plough on, hoping the track will improve but of course it gets longer and wetter and more miserable. No one comes here. It's the furthest from civilization, a waist-high mini-jungle and I feel like Papillon in Venezuela, cutting out virgin forest with his machete. My bike's momentum thrashes through the long grass and every inflorescence is like a wet sponge draining itself on my trousers. I imagine myself on a king's chair being carried through an adulatory crowd, like when we won a cup match in school, or like the Leinster players might have been doing today if Frawley's late drop-at-goal had crept over.

I can't go on like this so I dismount and volunteer to strand myself on the gravel beach. I whip off my shoes and socks and stuff them into my cycling trousers and that functions as a bag to attach to the bike's carrier. Then I lash on some trackie Bs and flip-flops which I thought might be useful for the rain. And they tobefair are. I can't believe I already have to use up my change of clothing as it'll be pissing on and off all day and I'll need them later. My torso is still dry so I at least won't get cold.

It's still maybe 3 or 4k to Five Mile Point where a road connects back to civilization but it's only 2k back to where the path was cycleable. The wrong way. I look back and think of giving up. I can still see my gaff above Wicklow Town, or at least the bastid apartments in front of it, blocking our view. When I get back on the road I'll not be able to motivate myself to set out again. And when will I even get out again? I've just let three months slip by with no new adventures. Moving house. Buying washing machines. Choosing Life. Sticking myself to the back of the priority list. It's painfully depressing to wake up every morning and have nothing to write about. Some play time to myself to keep my soul afloat while I die of boredom looking for a dull tech job slash die of mortification as I get rejected yet again.

I decide the crunch along the gravel beach, with the stones sucking up my momentum at every step, and I find a nice souvenir shell for the chunfla. It's no wonder no one comes to this terrain bar fisherman and dogwalkers, and even they don't come this far. Anyone looking for coastal solitude in the Greater Leinster Region would enjoy this. If they can get here. Gravel glares back at you irregularly, putting strain on the brain whereas smooth even sand repeats itself indefinitely, taking the hard work out of vision. Firm wet sand soaks up your stress and springs life into you with every step. Soft dry sand hugs your supine frame from below. Sand is the quintessence of beauty. Regular. Symmetrical. Easy on the eye.

### Farm escape

It's not long before a gap in the long grass emerges. A locked gate at a level crossing over the traintrack. So I scale the first two Spin 103.8s over the trainline, then there's a short bit of no man's land with willow trees in the marshy soil. After that I'm into a farm and back on my soothing bike again, unbothered by the road's roughness. I see cattle, with the farmhouse beyond, where the exit obviously is. The only way through is via their field and I'd rather turn back and swim for safety than take on the cattle who are now congregating at the gate in front of me. I look around and see a different farm to one side and a cluster of trees to the other, so I'm guessing that that'll be a road. I tramp across the field, admiring the long grass with little flowers and wet cobwebs between the blades. The shapes and colours bring joy on this grey day. The ground is stupidly rough, being subjected to tractors and cattle, but it's firm enough for flip-flops and getting to the gate and road is a huge relief. I'm back on the bike and I scale all the gates rather than messing with the farmer's ropey knots, providing evidence of trespassing. I get to the farmyard with tractors and horseboxes and big closed gates, but there's an entrance slash exit round the corner and I make for the road. I half want to knock and explain myself. I'm bricking it that the exit gate will be locked but it's mercifully open - possibly a face-saving gesture from the farmer. Gratitude overtakes me, for all the hard work that has been done by those before, tracing out safe, flat pathways for wheeled vehicles. I'm back cycling to Newcastle along the mellow foliage tunnel that reminds me of home, the Strawberry Beds. I wonder if maybe it's my calling to go and trace new paths for people, and I suppose that's what I'm kinda doing here. This trip is basically a recon job to see if a Wicklow coastal greenway is possible.

There's no time for coffee in Newcastle or to drop in to say hello to my sister so I plough on to Kilcoole village. I turn off for the coast and train station which is active but prohibitively far away on foot. The path from here to Greystones is walkable, I'm told by a dogwalker from Kilmacud who moved out here years ago, in an echo of my own exit from Dzublin, although back then it was so rural they shot *Glenroe* here, Ireland's *Emmerale*. The dog is off to Czechoslavakia soon because it belongs to the man's son but really to his ex-girlfriend who is heading back there after the old seven-year itch got the better of them. So the poor son, aged thirty-nine now, will be single, dogless and childless on entering middle-age, a fate that could go either way. Your man tells me I'll be able to bring the bike with me but wielding it across this terrain turns out to be miserable for about a kilometer. This is a place where local Sisypheans come and pound the rock while brushing shoulders on a few dozen inches of damaged rocks. From outside in it goes sea, boulders, **buttress rocks,** fence, trainline. The **buttress rocks** are two foot wide and misaligned from coastal pressure, while red valerian encroaches through the fence and I have to remove my trackie Bs again as the spongy flowers swoosh off my legs, soaking me afresh. One jogger declares it's the first time he's ever seen a bike here and I venture it'll be the last. There's no possibility for a greenway here, unless the council purchased the land off farmers on the other side of the track.

Kilcoole to Greystones terrain

-   rocks, gravel, sand, impossible non-walking terrain.

-   socks off, Shoudl ahve toaken off my trackie B too and shorts and slides can take a much wider range of climes than your common-or-garden slacks-socks-shoes combo

**Greystones**

1230 and I'm only gettting my second coffee of the day

happy pear, couple moving to Citywest aka Jobstown.

Wicklow, lowerarchy of niceness, gets nicer as you go south

Amble on photos of steps

maths v english, concussion + drink, come out on English side ???

Bray

Shankill -

Google maps leads me to a pleasingly unmanicured park but the rain starts to come and I'm removing my socks while cycling. But then the buckets arrive and I have to rescue my trackie Bs again Bray - vibrant strand, tourists at the head end, - ice cream, coffee, walking, swimming, little units - rocky, not a nice beach to be on but -- Joyce - Bray Head, whale quote - Me and my ice cream sit down next to a member of the old Bray, a toothless man a bit younger than me who is hangng on - teenage buskers struggle trhough a rendition of where is my mind but the lead singer's personality is light enough to make up for hte struggling drummer who reminds me of myself whenever I try to drum, overthinking it and thus getting it wrong. - Brayrut and palestine flags - the irony being how much more prestigious / affluent the place now is.\
to be applying for tech jobs or teaching at least I've still got spare dry clothes for later.

It's a kilometer or two back to the last level crossing over the Now the path narrows to a foot-wide track and the

separating it from the foot of the hills is a thin strip of flat land called the Murrough

normally you can see Bray Head

### Outtakes

It's lashing ninety outside and I'm praying it'll ease up soon so I can get a dry few hours before it pisses again around lunchtime. Yesterday was a day for the bike and the camera but Leinster were busy losing their third European Cup Final in a row, this time agin Toulouse, and I wasn't going to miss that for the world. I watched it with my folks, the two of them trembling like never before in their one hundred and seventy (plus) aggregated years, as the tense game moved into extra-time, after Ciaran Frawley missed a winning dropgoal by a cunthair, in a repeat of the 2014 semi-final, while a fella my size, the name of Antoine Dupont, repeatedly thwarted the Blue Magic.

Toulouse 31 - 22 Three Lose

We bumped into the lads in the airport after the first loss, away in France against La Rochelle in 2022. There was some issue with the baggage and our delayed carousel was beside theirs, and they stood in silence, all four-hundred stone of them, looking like they had seen Medusa, while Stuart Lancaster whispered in a few senior players' ears lest they remain petrified forever. Lord Only knows how they feel after three losses in a Sugar Ray.
