I still haven't made it to the little island lighthouse off Dalkey Island and there's also a chunk of coastline between there and Wicklow which I haven't cycled as part of this project, so I decide to just get it done while I have a chance.

I haven't been out for months and for two reasons.

-   One is that a lot of life has happened -

    -   moving, Badria, unemployment & the difficulty of managing time

-   the other is the raw distances. i need to be properly away

Yesterday was the day to do it EXPLAIN LEINSTER

I stall it up to Ocean View on top of the Mur de Wicklow to kick things off with what should be some of the best views in the Greater Lonster Region. It's an old council estate called Ocean View and nowadays its primo frontage would be snapped up for a premium, with a nice park on the steep field below. Instead, a local horse grazes there and its foal runs away at the sight of me and my steed. The wide arc of Wicklow Bay is intelligible from here and inside it is a thin flat strip of barely inhabited deposition called the Murrough, along which I'll be trying to cycle northwards. Inside that is the colonic Broad Lough which soaks up the River Vartry from the west before defecating south via the short fast Leitrim River and thence Wicklow Harbour with its little lighthouse. In the distance are Bray Head and the Sugar Loaves, their triangular peaks putting some shape on the irregular westward rise up to the mountains which I plan on acquainting myself with over the rest of my life. But it takes a really bad day like today to obscure the view this completely from here. My plan is to cycle as much of the coast between here and Bray and then head on towards Dalkey where I may or may not be able to catch a ferry to Dalkey island and get a closer to the lighthouse on the tiny Muggins. The first part of the trip is to get to Bray which is easy on a bike, following the Now I could take the so-called coast road from Wicklow-Rathnew to Newcastle but it is rather like the coast road running down most of Wexford, set back from the sea, and while it is a mellow to

I've waited until the worst of the rain has cleared and then I roll down to the harbour where a handful of motorists have parked up and are now yapping and stripping before their daily ablution. A concrete promenade follows the coast for a click, with a layer of boulders protecting it from the mostly benign sea. When I first came here I saw sea living and condo potensh where warehouses continue to rot. Now I see dole offices and a laggard town like a cushion in need of plumping. My vision is greater than my patience. At the railway bridge the concrete gives way to gravel and then it's just a track in the grass pounded out by dogwalkers, while the stoney beach parallels along for several miles. At the end of the bay is Five Mile Point and Newcastle airport, where my sister walks her dogs every morning. But that's like ten clicks away and I just don't know how traversable the path will be. I've cycled about 5k of this track before but couldn't find a viable exit road as the lake is in the way and some of the gates at the level crossings are locked. I've reccied a few turns off the so-called coast road between Wicklow The grass starts getting longer and now my shoe is getting wet. The track is clearly visible but

and already I'm glad I'm on the thick tyres of my wife's city bike. I don't know how far along this

Wicklow Bay is in the foreground from the harbour to Newcastle - they fucked the esate up here to keep the riffraff out of sight but the town has expanded - in the distance are Bray Head, the sugar loaf and other lesser known hills along which the mountain range - o and from there I can look out acroos most of East Wicklow, al I kick off the trip in Ocean View, an old council estate on the hill at the back of Wicklow Town
