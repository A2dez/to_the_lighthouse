### route

I still haven't made it to the little island lighthouse off Dalkey Island and there's also a chunk of coastline between there and Wicklow which I haven't cycled as part of this project, so I decide to just get it done while I have a chance.

I haven't been out for months and for two reasons.

-   One is that a lot of life has happened -

    -   moving, Badria, unemployment & the difficulty of managing time

-   the other is the raw distances. i need to be properly away

Yesterday was the day to do it EXPLAIN LEINSTER

### View

There's an old council estate called Ocean View hanging out the back of Wicklow Town, with some of the best views in the Greater Lonster Region, and it's the perfect spot to kick off my journey. The estate is up the top of the punishingly steep hill, and the location was presumably chosen to up keep the #riffraff at arm's reach back when the town's population was smaller. Nowadays its primo frontage would be snapped up for a premium, with a nice park on the steep field below. Instead a local horse grazes in peace while its foal runs away at the sight of me and my steed. There's a tiny shop and the litter outside reminds me of the more feckless era I grew up in, while the trailers and horseboxes survive from the rare aul' times. Scattered benches recognise the outstanding views and I sit down to soak it up.

On a clear day, you can see all the way from here to Bray and beyond, but it's too grey and gloomy to resolve much more than the contrast between land and water. The hockeystick shape of Wicklow Bay is intelligible from here and inside it is a thin flat strip of barely inhabited deposition called the Murrough, along which I'll be trying to cycle northwards, parallel to the train track (singular). Inside that is the colonic Broad Lough which soaks up the River Vartry from the west before defecating south via the short fast Leitrim River and thence into Wicklow Harbour with its little lighthouse. In the distance are Bray Head and the Sugar Loaves, their triangular peaks putting some shape on the irregular westward rise up to the Wicklow mountains with whom I plan on acquainting myself deeply over the rest of my life. At sunset their smooth tops bubble out of the ground, each one luring me to visit.

And on a mistless day you can see Howth and Lambay.

but visibility is poor today and all the hills between here Bray are obscured by clouds. My aim is to cycle as much of the coast between here and Bray and then head on towards Dalkey where I may or may not be able to catch a ferry to Dalkey island and get a closer to the lighthouse on the tiny Muggins.

### Coastline

The Wicklow Coastline is not a much-heralded place, unlike the mountains which retreat from it. The southern chunk is decent, The beaches are rocky and grind up against your feet whereas firm dense sand soaks up your stress and springs life into you with every step. Soft dry sand hugs your supine frame from below. Rocky beaches glare back at you irregularly, putting strain on the brain while smooth even sand repeats itself indefinitely, taking the work out of vision. Sand is the quintessence of beauty. Regular. Symmetrical. Easy on the eye.

But not a lot happens along the Wicklow coastline either. The county covers a surprisingly short amount of latitude, being just 52k from the arse end of Arklow up to Little Bray on the Dublin border where the yin and the yang combine. That's only 4k longer than the span of County Dublin, thenceforth to Bremore Castle at the far end of Balbriggan, and 11k longer than the Wee county a little beyond. That explains why I reckon I can see, on a very clear day, the Carlingford Peninsula in Ireland's sunny north-east, just 112 flat-earth clicks away.

The good beaches begin south of Wicklow Head, a poor man's Howth Head, with cliff walks and a lighthouse that no one goes to cos the train service is so poor. But the northern half is notable only for is featureless, especially the 18k as the crow flies from Wicklow to Greystones.

especially between Wicklow and Greystones, a distance of 18k as the crow flies.

The first part of the trip is to get to Bray which is easy on a bike, following the

Now I could take the so-called coast road from Wicklow-Rathnew to Newcastle but it is rather like the coast road running down most of Wexford, set back from the sea, and while it is a mellow to

I've waited until the worst of the rain has cleared and then I roll down to the harbour where a handful of motorists have parked up and are now yapping and stripping before their daily ablution. A concrete promenade follows the coast for a click, with a layer of boulders protecting it from the mostly benign sea. When I first came here I saw sea living and condo potensh where warehouses continue to rot. Now I see dole offices and a laggard town like a cushion in need of plumping. My vision is greater than my patience. At the railway bridge the concrete gives way to gravel and then it's just a track in the grass pounded out by dogwalkers, while the stoney beach parallels along for several miles. At the end of the bay is Five Mile Point and Newcastle airport, where my sister walks her dogs every morning. But that's like ten clicks away and I just don't know how traversable the path will be. I've cycled about 5k of this track before but couldn't find a viable exit road as the lake is in the way and some of the gates at the level crossings are locked. I've reccied a few turns off the so-called coast road between Wicklow The grass starts getting longer and now my shoe is getting wet. The track is clearly visible but

The so-called coast road between Rathnew and Newcastle then on to Kilcoole is another one of those inland distributor roads with occasional laneways leading down to the sea. It's a nice quiet road to cycle but there ain't no seaside to be seen. But the coast itself is typically layered, with a long straight rocky beach and a single train line which connects Dublin to Rosslare. In between is a narrow grassy verge, pounded out by dogwalkers coming north from Wicklow and south from Newcastle. I've cycled about 5k of this bumpy track before but it was doable with wide tyres and I'm determined to see if I can make it. Plus Strava's heatmap shows a thin line of usage suggesting traversability. But the wet grass starts getting longer and now it's wiping against my hiking boots, footwear I've chosen for today's hybrid terrain. I plough on, hoping the track will improve but it gets worse and I'm in a waist-high jungle now. I feel like Papillon in Venezuela, cutting out virgin forest with his machete. My bike's momentum thrashes through the long grass and every inflorescence is like a sponge draining itself on my trousers. It's also like I'm on a king's chair being carried through adulatory crowd, as the Leinster players might have been today if Frawley's late drop-at-goal had crept over. I can't go on like this so I dismout and I'm stranded on the beach. I already have to use up my change of clothing. I whip off my shoes and socks and stuff them into my cycling trousers which functions as a bag to attach to the bike's carrier. Then I lash on some trackie Bs and flip-flops which I thought might be useful for the rain. My torso is still dry so I won't get cold thankfully plus I'll have spare clothes for later. In the distance I can see my gaff above Wicklow town and I think about walking home. Maybe today is just not day for cycling. But when will I get out again? I've just let three months go by with no new adventures. It's painfully depressing to wake up every morning and have nothing to write about. Some playtime to myself to keep my soul afloat while I die of boredom looking for a new job slash die of mortification as I get rejected yet again. FARM TIME So I scale the first two gates over the trainline, learning quickly how to lift the bike (tekkerz). Then through the gap (willow trees in the water) and into the farm. Nice to be on a road, albeit a rough farm foad and then I see cattle, with the farmhouse beyond, where the exit obviously is. The only way through is via their field and I'd rather turn back and swim for safety than take on the cattle who are not congregating at the gate in front of me. So I look around and see a different farm to one side and a cluster of trees in a line to the other, so I'm guessing that that'll be a road. I tramp across the field now possibly being the first person to wear flip flops and a bike throug a cattle farm and I admire the long grass with little flours and wet cobwebs betwee blades. The ground is stupidly rough, being subjected to tractors and cattle, but it's firm enough and getting to the gate and road is a huge relief. i can cycle again but have several more gates to scale and thankfully it's not the sloppiest cattle farm I've ever been to. I arrive int he farmyard with tractors and horseboxes and more, and bi8g closed gates, but theres an exit/entrance round the corner and I make for the road. I half want to knocka nd explain myself. I'm thinking the gate will be locked but it's open - possibly ant0 . j . icipating my mortification - and I save face and am so delighted to be back on a road, grateful for the hard work that has been done by those before, tracing out safe, flat pathways for wheeled vehicles. I wonder if maybe it's my calling to go and trace new paths for people, and I suppose it is. This trip is basically a recon job to see if a greenway is possible here. \*\*\* Newcastle coast - an obscure part of the coast unvisited except by dogwalkers and fishermen - i've stretched into unwalked territory Kilcoole - stall it down to the train station which is prohibitively far from the town - get chatting to a dogwalker from Kilmacud who moved out here years ago, in an echo of my own exit from Dzublin. The dog is off to Czechoslavakia soon because it belongs to the man's son but really to his ex-girlfriend who is heading back there after the seven-year itch got the better of them. So the poor son, aged thirty-nine now, will be single, dogless and childless on entering middle-age, a fate that could go either way. - Wielding the bike across this terrain is miserable and I have to remove my trackie bs again as the HYDRANGEA? are swiping off them with ther - rocky walking - completely uncycleable for the next part. - a place where local sisypheans can come and pound the rock while brushing shoulders on a few dozen inchese of damaged rocks. ' first time I've ever seen a bike here' - no possibility for a greenway here, unless the council purchased the land off farmers. - Shankill - Google maps leads me to a pleasingly unmanicured park but the rain starts to come and I'm removing my socks while cycling. But then the buckets arrive and I have to rescue my trackie Bs again Bray - vibrant strand, tourists at the head end, - ice cream, coffee, walking, swimming, little units - rocky, not a nice beach to be on but -- Joyce - Bray Head, whale quote - Me and my ice cream sit down next to a member of the old Bray, a toothless man a bit younger than me who is hangng on - teenage buskers struggle trhough a rendition of where is my mind but the lead singer's personality is light enough to make up for hte struggling drummer who reminds me of myself whenever I try to drum, overthinking it and thus getting it wrong. - Brayrut and palestine flags - the irony being how much more prestigious / affluent the place now is.\
