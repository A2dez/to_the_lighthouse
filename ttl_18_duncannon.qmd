title: "Wexford Outtakes"
---

The sheer volume of lighthouses has been overwhelming me so I did a wordcount yesterday and realised I defo have enough for a Part 1 book, the Mild Non-Atlantic Way. Theres a couple of cycles and chapters to write, plus a few unfinished stragglers and a bit of editing to do, and I can lash together some maps too then submit the book - with like 80,000 words aka 300 pages - to a publisher. That's doble this by the end of the month when school's out and it's time for a new skedj. Then I can worry Pat Rafterwards about the Wild Atlantic Doris and all those pesky islands and Northern basically Ireland. 

I realised this on the Tuesday, had a look at the forecast and realised that Wednesday was the only option because Thursday and Friday are blanket rain in the Rainy South East. Packing up on Tuesday evening takes forever and I'm not asleep til flippin midnight, a behaviour that has little impact on what time I wake up. I make it to 6am, hit the Dermot at 7 and it's only like 65 Google minutes to Wexford. I lash on Automatic for the People cos I've been listening to some lectures about shame and I realised I need to transport myself back to the early 90s and look after that poor little boy who had to fend for himself in boarding school. It's pretty damn intense and i only make it as far as Sidewinder Sleeps Tonight before it gets too much and then I decide to start listening to Tim Fletcher' - the same dude's -  lectures about complex trauma. I don't get any further than *the essential characteristic of complex trauma is an inability to relax*, and then I lash it off knowing there'll be plenty to relate to later. 

I decide to approach Wexford from the Ferrybank side and have a gawk across the wide river. Over the bridge, there's all day parking for a Lady Godiva but I piss away 45 minutes looking for free parking and worrying about having an easier arrival this evening when I'm smashed. I've got a long day of it planned, picking up the outstanding lighthouses I've missed. I never saw Tuskar Rock from Rosslare Harbour when I was there and Lighthouse Pete noted that I missed Duncannon lighthouse(s) when me and Graham zipped past on our way to Hook Head. But this is really an excuse to check out the south Wexford coastline which I've missed along the way. I've 120k lined up plus pottering plus life so that'll be about 140k, as much as I've ever cycled in a day and almost the magical 100 miles aka 160.93km, a figure that's in my head on account of the athletics that's on at the moment. I eventually park up in the Tesco Extra near the town then mosey in to the centre to get some videos along the quays and then I go for coffee and a Barry in Cappuccino's Cafe on Main Street, which is one of the best streets in Ireland. A Dublin lady serves me and sends me up to the Union where I do my business. I hate getting my Barry on in public because toilet paper is really just a substance for drying your Gordon after you've washed it, not a cleaning implement in its own right. Using it is like claiming you've mopped the kitchen floor after wiping it with a dry J-cloth. 

I lash down a few notes outside and then head for a snap of St Iberius's church outside which I try to rest my Paul van agin a wobbly bollard. A shabby shamanic figure winks at me and suggests i don't park it there but i explain I'm about to take a photo to which he proffers some lowkey bigotry, wondering why I'm taking a photo of a Protestant Church. I tell him it all happened, whatever that means, and then he asks me if I'm from Dun Laoghaire. I tell him I'm actually from focking Lucan and he suggests I keep that to myself, with my hundred thousand euro accent, a figure that is not far wrong, once you convert from old money. Being racked with shame about my upbringing I set about needlessly explaining myself, an onerous, humourless task that I plan on finally getting over, now that I understand how much shame riddles my existence. Next time I'm just going to say that my aulwan was a lowkey snob who sent me to "a well-known North Kildare pratt factory that turns rich boggers into D4 dickheads", as The Slate so brutally put it back in the Caelan. It turns out your man is a bit of a machine whisperer and he's telling me now about how the handlebars are too far forward on my bike and also need to be raised, and so too much pressure is on my shoulders not my lower back. He suggests I arch my back a wee bit as I cycle to take the load off. This explains the pains in my shoulders. Then he spots that the bearings on my back wheel are banjoed and he tells me to call him later if I need help. He also decides to send me the phone number for Ken the bike man who won't empty your wallet and I suggest we catch up for a Brit Award once I'm back in town later. 

Ken doesn't open til 10 and I'm anxious bounce pronto. so I just hit the proverbial and head out towards the Rosslares.

\
I was disappointed to miss Rosslare Strand the last day so I jump off the N25 and head out there, although Google Mops chucks a needless detour at me because it hates to see cyclists on an N road, even though it calls it the 'Three (pause) N25', a name I cannot understand until I start to see the number 3 on the EuroVelo signs that pepper the junctions here. The road dodges the Sloblands, an interesting chunk of reclaimed land with no through road and it's just few clicks of flat farmland. There's a crossroads on arrival with village to the left and the beach being just 100 yards in front, so I head there and admire the view of Wexford Bay and down to Rosslare Harbour where the dark lighthouse is visible. The beach is clean and sandy but littered with fist-sized rocks near the entrance point. I sit down and take some videos to talk about what's going on so far but I'm not happy with the format. I feellike more needs to be happening otherwise I just fill the gap with slightly rushed chat. Maybe I just need to practice and leave in some long Dan Carlin-y pauses while I gather thoughts. There's an aulpair resting on a bench so I sit down nearby and start munching on biscuits and cheese.\
I open weather chat and it turns out the couple have driven down from Arklow today. The husband tells me the cove is a better swimspot than the Hanging Rock as the floor is flatter but he laments the loss of the North Beach which was washed away by Hurricane Charlie\
ADD NOTES\
He tells me more about the proud history of Arklow industry. Munitions factories and locals moving to South Africa after. Hotels by the North Beach. His own time as a Shipwright. He tells me "I'm a shipwright", as though he was heading back to the job after this little break, but clearly the job is even more deeply ingrained in his head than, say, me being a writer, which I struggle to identify with because i don't get paid for it and I'm too ashamed to just go for it. It's nice to see this depth of attachment to a craft. He tells me about laying the oak on an even keel and the Jim the supervisor coming to make sure the work was in order and afterwards he'd have to reset the wood to where it was. Angela, his wife, is laughing now, as if she's never heard the story before. I am too and I tell him them nothing has changed. Cunts doing shit to keep other cunts happy, I think.\
We end up having a bit of coda chat about waste water issues and the lack of new housing in the town and he mentions being town foreman during the late Celtic Tiger, presumably before the town fell complete apart and I'm guessing it was his retirement age.\
I grab some UPF juice in the Centra and make my way up the village where the SuperValu Tidy Towns people have interfaced nicely with the cash has clearly been pumped into the village. The cafes and restaurants look plush while Kelly's Hotel looks like it is a Mediterranean Resort with Palm Trees and a sculpted Fir Tree. It seems that the Sixties Mediterranean Resort aesthetic has landed here, a wee bit of the continent that has leaked onto the land of endless winter. A community centre with LIST MULTIPLE FACILITIES\
I mosey up the inner side of the burrow, beyond the end of the village, past some very nice holiday homes and then onto a tiny entrance at the end of the strand on the inner side of the expansive Wexford Bay. I'm delighted to see it from this side AND THE LAY OF THE LAND BEHIND. The water is Caribbean clear and a wee boat chillaxes in the shallow sea. I say hello to a few downandbackers out walking and I stop to look at a beautiful stone monument of the lifeboat that was used in like 1914 to rescue a wodge of Dano-Norwegian sailers on Tuskar Rock. Two ladies come, one a regular explaining the story to her clearly visiting friend. The regular is a classic of the genre, getting the most out of the summer season. Tank top, shades, no-nonsense short grey hair. Long walks in the morning. Vino of a presumably evening. I ask her about viewing Tuskar Rock and she tells me where to go in Rosslare Harbour and that there's a replica on a roundabout. It's a bit of a doublebackarooney but I can't miss it.\
It turns out that I did miss it because I turned off at Ashfield Roundabout where it sits, a needlessly tiny but beautiful replica of the real lighthouse. Clearly somebody's visions of a roundabout column was compromised and this fifteen-foot toy replica is only half visible behind the signposts, when real roundabout art ought to dominate the space like any good beacon.\

Exit strat\

In a bygone day I could have taken the Ballinbola train home\
I can't leave the phone to charge somewhere because I need it to take a photo of the lighthouses, and then I'll need to charge it for five minutes after just to make it back using Ultra Battery mode. So I wander round the strand and take a snap of it from the strand. I'm lucky the tide is out a bit. I whip off my smelly gear, lob on my swimming jocks and run into to the ankle-high sea. I try to rinse myself quickly in the shallow water but  it's like being in a scabby bath that used to belong to your sister. My skin is encrusted with a long day's worth of crystallized salts. It's like I've been rolled around a giant packet of dioralyte and I doubly regret not getting my rinse on in Kilmore Quay. I'm raging because the water's not punishingly cold and I really wish I could lie back and start learning how to cool my jets in the water like a normal punter.\
I dress back up half-arsed because I have no towel and then I charge my phone in the shop yonder while soothing myself with a quick cup of Afternoon Tea, sitting on a low wall while watching chunflaz kicking a ball round the village's central junction. It's about 720 and i reckon I'll make it back to Wexford in two hours with wind on my back cancelling out the tiredness in my scramblers.\
ADD NOTES here\
The water is shallower than a scabby bath and I'm worrying about the time. I'm raging because the water is not punishingly cold and now I know the other reason why I can't just chill in the water. It's cos I can't relax. I'm going to have to legiterally  train myself to chill the beans.\

Calling James was a big step for me. Now admittedly, my options weren't great as the bus was gonzo already so I'd've had to thumb a lift from someone, but that's not the point. I knew from earlier that asking for helps was a live option and it was really great to have to safety net.\
A bizarre side effect is that I will now more likely keep on top of my bike maintenance because if I going to be asking people for help then I'll have to do my bit and limit the likelihood of my needing to ask them.\
Waiting for James is a welcome comedown from the brainfrazzling nature of cycling and I charge my units while drinking green actual tea. He rocks up in a van and steps out with a smile and no shoes. He spots a missing screw in my derailleur and reckons I'll need a newbie. Good excuse to bring the bike in and have its geometry rearranged too. He suggests I stall it back for a shower in his gaff and I offer to take us both out for food. We get down to a rapid-fire catch up of each other's backstory, the work he does with the homeless people of Wexford and the fact that he can't offer me a bed because there is already a homeless guy on his couch. Once he hears that I'm on the scratch myself he suggests we grab ingredients in a supermarket and cook it in his. So we park up by my Jammer outside Tesco, lob my banjoed Paul van into the boot and then wander inside to get ingredients. He wants to cook me his signature steak and french toast and I'm more than happy to oblige.\
and it turns out he moved to Wexford from South Africa when he was four  \
James shows up even quicker than expected\
