**0600, 12 June, 2024**

The thought of cycling to a few score more lighthouses on the other side of the island has been overwhelming me, so yesterday I did a wordcount and I was just there looking at it, going, I can make a standalone book out of this. *To the lighthouse, part 1: The mild non-Atlantic way.* What remains is a manageable quantity of cycling, writing and mapmaking, which I can possibly dunzo this month before school's out and it's time for a summer skedj with the sprogs. Then I can worry Pat Rafterwards about the Wild Atlantic Doris and all those pesky islands and Northern dauntingly Ireland, maybe lash out a volume apiece for each of them. The idea only crystallized yesterday, so I had a look at the Freddy Forecast and decided to hit the Dermot today because the sun will be shining in the Sunny South East and there's blanket rain forecast for tomorra.

### Route

I've got a long summer's day of it planned, picking up some outstanding lighthouses I've missed around the Wexford Coast. Lighthouse Pete noted that I missed the Duncannon lighthouses when me and Gk zipped past on our way to Hook Head. I also never saw Tuskar Rock from Rosslare Harbour when I was there so I'm gonna go and hunt for it. But this is really an excuse to check out the south-east Wexford coastline which I've skipped over. I also want to know whether it has as good a case as Waterford for being included in the Wild Atlantic Way. I've 120 clicks lined up which could be 140 with tangents on top, and that's as much as I've ever cycled in a day, almost the magical 100 miles aka 160.93km, a figure that's in my head on account of the athletics that's on at the moment.

**Sharlene and Rhasidat running for more medals tonight. Ciara Mageean having slowly ascended to a championship gold. The accents are a whistlestop tour of the island. Rhasidat, from somewhere in Tallaght, has a new mix of Old Dublin, where every second word ends in a /h/, and that aspirational Gen Zeeer intonation you hear when they drink with relish their fifteen-euro cocktails. *I just want to inspire the next generation just like others inspired me.* If you can't see it, you can't be it. I can't hear any of the grumpy Brochat I used to hear every day among the black teenagers in Blanch libro, where African influences have blended into West Dublin's as-yet coagulating accents, leaving space for a distinct social identity to be expressed. Although maybe it just fades away after school when your localized curiosities get diluted out by the big bad wuddled.**

**The lightbulb of shame**

Packing up last night took donkeys, between fixing punctures and a whole bunch of positive procrastination tasks like doing laundry and sorting out the guest bedroom for possibly Airbnbers, an intrusive set up that might save me from the horror of working for the man. I'm just off the back of an unrepeatable month of Metro Boulot Dodo up in Dzublin. Never again. Last night I didn't hit the hashtag til nearly midnight but I thankfully I slept until 6am and I'm in the Boola Bogger by 7. I'd take the Ballinboola train but there's none til a quarter to frikkin eleven. It's only like 65 Google minutes to Wexford, and I decide to spend the drive nursing the poor litle boy inside me who had to fend for himself in boarding school. I lash on *Automatic for the People*, as *Man on the Moon* recently set me off, while in the juicer no less, and I only make it as far as *Sidewinder Sleeps Tonight* before it's all too much. I'm back listening to Atlantic 252 in the car with my mam on the way home from school every Saturday afternoon. I've been listening to some lectures about shame and I'm both apalled and delighted to find out how much shame and negative opinion I have<https://www.independent.ie/regionals/wexford/news/ladys-island-church-restored-to-former-glory/35288573.html> of myself. I've only been looking into it for a fortnight now but the changes have already been massive. Suddenly I can suddenly see so much what I do wrong. And doubly so as a parent, channelling the horror through the generations. Afterwards, I start listening to Tim Fletcher' - the same dude's - lectures about about complex trauma. I don't get any further than *the essential characteristic of complex trauma is an inability to relax*, and then I lash it off knowing there'll be plenty to relate to later.

### **Wexford**

![*St Iberius' church, built with a 'Venetian Renaissance aesthetic' in the mid-late eighteenth century, provides more evidence of the continent leaking onto Ireland via this South-Eastern corner.*[^ttl_18_duncannon-1]](WhatsApp%20Image%202024-06-15%20at%2008.20.38.jpeg)

[^ttl_18_duncannon-1]: <https://www.discoverireland.ie/wexford/st-iberius-church>

[^ttl_18_duncannon-2]: <https://www.discoverireland.ie/wexford/st-iberius-church>

I decide to approach Wexford from the Ferrybank side and have a gawk across the river at the lovely town slash future city whose atmos I'm fond of. Over the bridge, there's all day parking for a Lady Godiva but, instead of stumping up, I push on and piss away 45 minutes looking for free parking and worrying about having an easier arrival this evening when I'm smashed. Old habits, eh. I eventually park up in a Tesco Extra then mosey in to the town to take some videos along the quays and I'm thinking it'd be nice to see that far off sticky uppy bit at the southern end of the bay. I go for a needless coffee and a necessary Barry in Cappuccino's Cafe on Main Street. A Dublin lady serves me and points me up to the Union. I hate doing my business in public because toilet paper is really just a substance for drying your Gordon after you've washed it, not a cleaning implement in its own right. Using it is like claiming you've mopped the kitchen floor after wiping it with a dry J-cloth.

I stall it back outside to watch the world and lash down a few notes before pottering across the road for a snap of St Iberius's church, outside which I try to rest my Paul van agin a wobbly bollard. A shabby, shamanic figure, bearded and built like a veteran tighthead, winks at me and suggests I don't park it there. I explain I'm about to take a photo and he offers to take one of me and it and the church. He proffers some lowkey bigotry, wondering why I'm taking a photo of a Protestant Church. I tell him it all happened, whatever that means, and he asks me if I'm from Dun Laoghaire. I tell him I'm actually from fockin Lucan and he suggests I keep that to myself, with my hundred thousand euro accent, a figure that is not far wrong, once you convert from old money. Being racked with shame about my #priviliged upbringing, I set about needlessly explaining myself, an onerous, humourless bit of bait I frequently take. Next time I'm just going to say that my aulwan was a lowkey snob who sent me to "a well-known North Kildare pratt factory that turns rich boggers into D4 dickheads", as *The Slate* magazine so brutally put it back in the Daniel. After that my accent was mostly formed via Trinners for winners and boozers for losers.

It turns out your man - James - is a bit of a machine whisperer. He's got a forty-year-old Viking for sale if I'm interested (a Viking bicycle, not the invasive species), cos he wants someone who won't mess with the aesthetic. I've already got a thirty-year old Viking at home - I wonder if Paul McQuaid called it *Blue* *Thunder* because of the brand? - and it's time I treated myself to a nice new bike. Your man is telling me now about how the handlebars are too far forward on my bike. Too much pressure is on my shoulders not my lower back. He suggests I take the load off by arching my back a wee bit as I cycle. This explains the pains in my shoulders and why descending is so painful on this bike. Then he spots that the bearings on my back wheel are banjoed and he tells me to call him later if I need help. He also decides to send me the phone number for Ken the bike man who won't empty your wallet and I suggest we catch up for a Brit Award once I'm back in town later.

### **Rosslare Strand**

![*Hanging out the back of Rosslare Strand is the Wexford Bay Caribbean.*](ttl_18_duncannon_photos/WhatsApp%20Image%202024-06-15%20at%2007.38.40%20(2).jpeg)

I'm anxious to bounce pronto, and Ken doesn't open for another half an hour, so I just hit the proverbial and head out towards the Rosslares, first to Rosslare Strand which I was disappointed to miss the last day. The road to the strand dodges the Sloblands, a flat chunk of reclaimed farmland with no road across its river. A *slob*, it turns out, comes from the Irish word *slab*, meaning *muddy land*, with the metaphorical meaning of an slovenly person coming later.[^ttl_18_duncannon-3] There used to be an island there, home to Ibar of Beggerin, the above mentioned St Iberius, one of Ireland's four early bishops who may have been sent here by St Patrick when they buzzing about on Mediterranean Islands.[^ttl_18_duncannon-4] It makes sense that there must have been some early adopters to help Pat the Snaker spread the word.

Gueegle Mops does its best to send me out that way, needlessly diverting me off the N25 due to its distaste for cyclists on main roads. **Yet it keeps calling it the the 'Three N25', a strange moniker that is only explained when the signposts suggest I am on Euro Velo Route 3, The Pilgrim's Path (although I am yet to find a map of this).** I'm back on the N25 and fork off at a roundabout for Rosslare Strand. There's a crossroads on arrival with a village to the left and the beach being just 100 yards in front, so I head there and admire the view upstrand towards the East Wexford Coast and downstrand to Rosslare Harbour where the little harbour lighthouse marks the outmost point. The beach is clean and sandy but littered with fist-sized rocks near the entrance point, and ugly groynes are evenly spaced along the beach. Palm trees and beach entrances remind me of Cranfield Point up North and an earlier generation of second-homers retreating to the coast. Maps explain the 16k loop around the strand but later I find out that the strand used to be much longer before the manmade harbour and Sloblands began to impact beach system.[^ttl_18_duncannon-5]

I sit down on a boulder and take some videos to talk about what's been going on so far today but I'm not happy with the format. There is an underdeveloped version of me that takes videos of places and uploads them to YouTube but the format I like - commentating on people - seldom works in the remote places I cycle to. I feellike more needs to be happening otherwise I just fill the gap with slightly rushed chat. Maybe I just need to practice and leave in some long Dan Carlin-y pauses while I gather thoughts.

There's an aulpair resting on a bench so I sit down nearby and start munching on my biscuits and cheese. I open with weather chat and it turns out the couple have driven down from Arklow today. I mention my beloved Hanging Rock beach but the husband tells me the cove is a better swimming spot as the water is more level. But they lament the loss of the North Beach which was washed away by Hurricane Charlie, and suddenly I can remember me and my sister Maggs looking out the window, petrified. That hurricane and HIV/Aids were the scariest things I remember from my halcyon early years before boarding school. The husband talks about the proud history of Arklow industry, a pleasing contrast to what folk my age say about the town, 'my da said it will never come to anything'. Munitions factories in the '20s and locals moving to South Africa after. Hotels by the North Beach. Shipbuilding. He tells me "I'm a shipwright", as though he was heading back to the job after this little break. He tells me about laying the oak on an even keel and the Jim the supervisor coming to make sure the work was in order and afterwards he'd have to reset the wood to where it was. Angela, the wife, is laughing now, as if she's never heard the story in their fifty-odd years of marriage. I tell them nothing has changed. But I'm just looking at him and thinking, punters keeping other punters happy. Not my modus operandi.

![*Further evidence of Med vibes leaking onto the island can be seen at Kelly's Resort Hotel in Rosslare Strand*](ttl_18_duncannon_photos/WhatsApp%20Image%202024-06-15%20at%2007.38.40%20(1).jpeg)

I grab a UPF isotonic in the Centra and make my way up the village where local cash has interfaced nicely with the SuperVolu TidyTowns people. Floral decorations complement the nicely painted cafes and restaurants, unlike the usual attempt to put make-up on a pig. Kelly's Resort Hotel has that 1960s Med vibe, with palm trees and a sculpted fir tree behind. Beyond it is a very well kitted out community centre, and I feellike all villages of a certain size ought to have the following: "*a wide range of onsite facilities including a Playground, 18 hole Crazy Golf course, 3 Tennis Courts, Bowls, Running Track, Basketball, All Weather Pitch, Football Pitch, Indoor hall, and spaces for a variety of fitness classes \[ , \] all new Padel Tennis courts \[ and \] venues for meetings and training events'*.[^ttl_18_duncannon-6]

[^ttl_18_duncannon-6]: <https://www.rosslareholidayresort.ie/rosslare-communit--sports-centre>

Beyond the village, the inner side of the long sand spit has a buncha nice one-off holiday homes, some with an extra mobile home for the possibly children, and the road leads to a tiny entrance to the Wexford side of the expansive bay. The water is calm and Caribbean clear and I'm delighted to see this side of the expansive Wexford Bay. It reminds me of the Mar Menor inside La Manga in Spain and I'm wondering if we'll get out that way this year. I miss the heat. A wee boat chillaxes in the shallow sea. I say hello to a few downandbackers out walking and I stop to look at a beautiful stone monument of the lifeboat that was used in 1914 to rescue a wodge of Dano-Norwegian sailers clinging to Tuskar Rock. Two ladies come, one a regular explaining the story to her clearly visiting friend. The regular is a classic of the genre, getting the most out of the #SummerSeason. Tank top, shades, no-nonsense short grey hair. Long walks in the morning. Vino of a presumably evening.

### Tuskar Replica

I ask her about viewing Tuskar Rock and she tells me I can see it from the playground in Rosslare Harbour. But she also asks if I've seen the replica on the roundabout on my way here. I haven't and It's a bit of a doublebackarooney but I can't miss it. It turns out that I have already missed it because it was on the roundabout where I turned off the N25. Normally, roundabout art always contains a big fukov, unmissable structure, that can be appreciated by a motorist whizzing by. But this cute little laddie squats low enough that the signposts block the view. The structure is beautiful and was part of that wave of great lighthouses designed by George Halpin in the 1810s.

![*This couple are part of a nine-month long protest against the replacement of a locally-needed nursing home with nationally-needed International Protection Accommodation.*](ttl_18_duncannon_photos/WhatsApp%20Image%202024-06-15%20at%2007.38.42.jpeg)

### Rosslare Harbour

I head on to Rosslare Harbour and follow your wan's directions. Turn right at the church then head to the playground in St Brendan's *council* estate, she was sure to point out. From there I'll be able to see it. But after the church I spot a nine-month long protest so I stop to see what the Jacques Chirac is. There's purple and yella signs all over the gaff and an ageing couple sit outside a little house. It turns out a nursing home was planned but it's being gazumped by an International Protection Accommodation centre. They couple said there'll be hundreds of men hanging around the town with nothing to do and they tell me about an eighty-seven year old man who has to get lifts into Wexford to see his wife instead of walking down here. Whatever about using hotels to house people in need, I venture, it hardly makes sense to oust the elderly and infirm in favour of other people in need. They tell me the jobs are all gone from the town and, while their kids had the choice of staying in the town to work, mostly in tourism jobs, the grandkids have no option but to leave. A few minutes later another fella is telling me how many more ferries are coming in this way thanks to Brexit, and it seems a shame to have no hotels for the tourists. It's hard to see why why this village is not booming, with a deepwater port connecting us to the continent, and none of your landbridge nonsense with the belligerent Brexiteers in between #UKoff.

![Tuskar Rock lighthouse, about 10k south-east of Rosslare harbour.](ttl_18_duncannon_photos/WhatsApp%20Image%202024-06-15%20at%2007.38.42%20(1).jpeg)

I'm at the playground now, atop a little cliff, watching the harbour below in action. A ferry cruises up and reverses into its berth. Nearby a team of high-viz workers continue to expand the roads and prep the port for all this extra business. There's a skinny beach between here to there behind which sits a grid of paths which have been cut through the long grass slash little sand dunes. Up here on the cliff a roughish gravel path follows the coast and soon I can see Tuskar Rock in the distance. A fella tells me I can walk the field out to Greenore Point - the farmer doesn't mind - but the lighthouse doesn't get any nearer. What a champ.

It's after 1 now and it's time to Moroccan Ryle Nugent. My heart is broken to not head out to the very south-eastern edge of Ireland, Carnsmore Point, but it's a 25k doublebackarooney job because a long beach - aka burrow - has replaced the Norman coastline and I don't know if it's traversible without the right bike and maybe some huskies. Some maps explain the walking routes along the South Wexfrod Coast, and it might be worth doing some other time. It's proper rural between Rosslare and Lady's Island and it's good to be cycling and my brain needs a break. There's not much en route bar signposts for Euro Velo, the Norman Way, and spuds for sale. Lady's Island explains a lot about the geography of South Wexford. There used to be a bay and an island but the above-mentioned burrow clogged it up, leaving a lake behind and a skinny island reattached to the land. The village is dominated by a tall skinny church on the land side and protected castle ruins sit on the erstwhile island alongside various religious icons. The Stations of the Cross have been rendered in mosaic, and there's there's a large shrine to Our Lady. A noticeboard shows artist renderings of miserable-looking pilgrims on their knees in the water. I bet the lads in Mecca will be having better craic on Friday for Hajj.

![*Kilmore Quay is a fishing village with some tourist stuff attached.*](ttl_18_duncannon_photos/WhatsApp%20Image%202024-06-15%20at%2007.38.45.jpeg)

I plough on another 20k towards Kilmore Quay. It's proper *This is Belgium* territory. My phone is dead so it's a good excuse to ask for directions and listen to the locals who all have chainsaws and a double-take accent. Two aulflas on a wall tell me not to take the first road as it's fierce rough, and it must be because the one I'm on feels like a sector of Paris-Roubaix cobbles. I legiterally have to choose my line. I can barely understand the next fella but his directions tally with the signposts that start to emerge, so I'm clearly resurfacing. I eventually come to Kilmore - the plain one - and Mary Barry's Seafood restaurant is jammers outside. It's probably the place to be but I want to eat by the sea so I punch on to Kilmore Quay, which is a bit of a let down, even the low-lying Saltee Islands across the water could do with a cheeky volcano or something. I ask a few heads where the swimspot is - never a good sign at the seaside - and my sense is that this is a fishing village with tourists attached. The central features of the town are the harbour - fair enough - and a roundabout too small to hang on to its traffic, like a small planet with too many moons.

There's a casual looking seafood restaurant with a wodge of eaters outside so I decide to let the people's choice dictate but it turns out to be a chipper and now I know my belly is gonna be up against it. I order fish, chips, coffee and beer, and I sit inside to write my notes and charge my Tony. I stay awhile, grab another Britney and then relieve myself in the Barryer. Waiting patiently outside is an aulwan who points out that I was in the Ladies Bathroom, as if I ought to have waited patiently outside the engaged men's toilet. She's one of those pass-remarkable tossers who have dominated the emotional pitch of this nation for longer than societal memory reaches back and we'll be a happier people when we've shed her passive aggressive kind. I'm delighted to see her following me straight out as the smell must have put her off. It urns out to be a good thing cos I've left my Tony Blair in the Union. A couple of polite but cold Canadian cyclists are stationed outside. I yoink a dab of suncream off them while trying to have the craic but they need another twenty rubs of the green before they loosen up.

It's after 4 now and I've still got nearly 80k to go, 40 to Duncannon and the same back to Wexford. I get my head down and cycle, via Duncormick, another village whose bay has been mostly cut off by a burrow. The fish and chips are rumbling in my Nedzer and I have to dismount and gag a few times. Never again. I soon arrive in Carrick-on-Bannow, familiar territory near where we camped last year after the Hook Head trip, the whole family, baby and cat included, althought poor Puddens ran off and hid in a ditch all weekend. There was a nice big barn for playing Jenga and drinking a bag of cans with the kids, but it wouldn't be my go-to for a Brad, Paddy and a Mexican. The campsite proprietress, who farms cattle on the other side of the ditch, seemed to think it was a good idea to leave the electric fence on, telling me that everyone in Ireland knew how they worked. I told her that that my six year old from Dublin had taken a widdle near it in the middle of the night.

I take the bay road to Wellingtonbridge, knowing I'll be able to look across at Clonmines, a well-preserved, abandoned Norman village which used to be a trading port. Again, the bay has been heavily silted and is no longer navigable. Wellingtonbridge, however, functions as a meeting point for Bannow Peninsula, the Hook Peninsula and the road to Wexford. I know the petrol station there has lots of charging points, and signs telling van people not to slop out in the jacks, so I stall it there for some fluids and to wash my filthy hands and face. I'm getting worried it'll be dark later so I ask about and the staff tell me there's a LocalLink bus to Wexford at 8. They might not take my bike but it's worth a try if needed.

It's my last pit stop and then I take the curiously straight road for Arthurstown and eventually left to Duncannon. I've never been happier to have a breeze on my face as I know I'll be needing it on the way back. It's 7 bells agin I arrive and the village is quiet for a summer's evening, just a few teenage lads out aimlessly kicking a football in the town centre, a local minimum by the long beach where the roads all converge. Geegle Mops is pointing me up to the Fort but the lighthouse there is inaccessible and then a long-established Polish lady, with dog as big as my bike, sends me towards the other one. Ish. I pop down to the fishing port where a seasoned local knows his stuff. The North lighthouse, which we can see on high up the road, is in someone's legiterally garden and the Commisioner of Irish Lights are fussy about people going in. Insurance and all the rest of it. I take a crap photo with my 1% charged phone and he tells me I'll be able to view the other one from the strand, round the corner. Thankfully the tide is out and I point the phone up and at it. You can only go in on a tour of the fort. I'm not bothered because it's only the completist in me who wants to snap these pictures, and I'm happy to let Lighthouse Pete, guesting on Tides and Tales blog, tell [tell the story](https://tidesandtales.ie/the-duncannon-lighthouses/.).

Photo\
In a bygone day I could have taken the Ballinbola train home

\
I can't leave the phone to charge somewhere because I need it to take a photo of the lighthouses, and then I'll need to charge it for five minutes after just to make it back using Ultra Battery mode. So I wander round the strand and take a snap of it from the strand. I'm lucky the tide is out a bit. I whip off my smelly gear, lob on my swimming jocks and run into to the ankle-high sea. I try to rinse myself quickly in the shallow water but it's like being in a scabby bath that used to belong to your sister. My skin is encrusted with a long day's worth of crystallized salts. It's like I've been rolled around a giant packet of dioralyte and I doubly regret not getting my rinse on in Kilmore Quay. I'm raging because the water's not punishingly cold and I really wish I could lie back and start learning how to cool my jets in the water like a normal punter.\
I dress back up half-arsed because I have no towel and then I charge my phone in the shop yonder while soothing myself with a quick cup of Afternoon Tea, sitting on a low wall while watching chunflaz kicking a ball round the village's central junction. It's about 720 and i reckon I'll make it back to Wexford in two hours with wind on my back cancelling out the tiredness in my scramblers.\
ADD NOTES here\
The water is shallower than a scabby bath and I'm worrying about the time. I'm raging because the water is not punishingly cold and now I know the other reason why I can't just chill in the water. It's cos I can't relax. I'm going to have to legiterally train myself to chill the beans.

**Wellingtonbridge return**

It's 38k bakc to Wexford which I'm hoping will take me two hours, with the wind on my back cancelling out the aches in my spine, and Wellingtonbridge at 15k makes for a nice intermediary target, but the lumpiness of Waterford has leaked over the county border and I could really do with these mild undulations.\
\
Calling James was a big step for me. Now admittedly, my options weren't great as the bus was gonzo already so I'd've had to thumb a lift from someone, but that's not the point. I knew from earlier that asking for helps was a live option and it was really great to have to safety net.\
A bizarre side effect is that I will now more likely keep on top of my bike maintenance because if I going to be asking people for help then I'll have to do my bit and limit the likelihood of my needing to ask them.\
Waiting for James is a welcome comedown from the brainfrazzling nature of cycling and I charge my units while drinking green actual tea. He rocks up in a van and steps out with a smile and no shoes. He spots a missing screw in my derailleur and reckons I'll need a newbie. Good excuse to bring the bike in and have its geometry rearranged too. He suggests I stall it back for a shower in his gaff and I offer to take us both out for food. We get down to a rapid-fire catch up of each other's backstory, the work he does with the homeless people of Wexford and the fact that he can't offer me a bed because there is already a homeless guy on his couch. Once he hears that I'm on the scratch myself he suggests we grab ingredients in a supermarket and cook it in his. So we park up by my Jammer outside Tesco, lob my banjoed Paul van into the boot and then wander inside to get ingredients. He wants to cook me his signature steak and french toast and I'm more than happy to oblige.\
and it turns out he moved to Wexford from South Africa when he was four\
James shows up even quicker than expected\

Outtakes

It's nice to see this depth of attachment to a craft.

, **but clearly the job is even more deeply ingrained in his head than, say, me being a writer, which I struggle to identify with because i don't get paid for it and I'm too ashamed to just go for it**.

**We end up having a bit of coda chat about waste water issues and the lack of new housing in the town and he mentions being town foreman during the late Celtic Tiger, presumably before the town fell complete apart and I'm guessing it was his retirement age.**
