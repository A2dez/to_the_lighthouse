East Cork

"Clonvilla is the definition of the middle of nowhere", says the fella on the phone from the mobile home park in Youghal which doesn't do tents. Very few spots in the municipal district of East Cork do tents and, if no one wants to holiday there, it suggests the coastline will be abitmeh, at least by Ireland standards. There's another campsite closer to Cork city, in like *¿west* East cork?, but the reviews suggest it is a bit of a Brad Swiss, with zero facilities, and a motorway for a soundtrack. So Clonvilla it is. Plus I want to revisit scaldyball Youghal and whence continue my way round the coastline. I'd've stalled it down here a fortnight ago but the tourist boat out to Ballycotton lighthouse is banjoed and I've been waiting patiently for its resuscitation. It's still not fixed but I've had enough now cos I wanna dunzo out this book, so I'm bringing the fam with me seeing as it school holiday time and our seven-year-old would only be sat at home, gamely twiddling his thumbs.

And not only are we off on our holiers, but we've got Airbnb guests paying for it. We spent the guts of the week prepping the Roisin to go up on the Airbnb website - clean and snap, clean and snap, for every room in the gaff - and then by the time we had guests booked, the whole gaff needed to be recleaned, with our existence being largely airbrushed out aka wedged into cupboards. The whole task was multiplied in its difficulty by the steadfast burglarizing tekkerz of our seventeen-month-old daughter, a live entropy monster who can empty five cupboards faster than you can empty one dishwasher. The whole ordeal is agonizingly stressful, and henceforth we need to outsource the clean-up job, which is a thing, according to Kilroy who regularly puts up his gaff when he gets out of Dodge. But once the gaff is in order, you're looking at a free basically holiday. A couple of spoofers book it and offer cash and I stupidly agree. We have the gaff like 80% ready to go on Friday night when they cancel via WhatsApp voice message. Something about Balbriggan being where the real value in the housing market lies. In the morning, neither of us has the emotional bandwidth to finish off the job and my wife just calls it, so we jam half the gaff into the Boola Bogger and hit the proverbial at like half eleven, happy to run away from the unfinished mess. It's a single-shot drive to East Cork, but we pick up a wodge of camping gas in Dungarvan and then I'm oddly proud to show off Youghal to my wife and she declares it, in its natural beauty, to be the next Bray, although it's possibly more of a Brayrut.

We arrive in our campsite in time for a cheeky afternoon shower which clears the ground of any unwanted dust. The campsite is tight and does, as one reviewer suggests, feel like camping in someone's back garden. There's fewer than thirty pitches, between static mobile homes, caravans and campervans passing through, and a few of us third-class citizens in tents. The place promotes itself as a stop-off point between the holiday hubs of West Cork and Wexford, and that includes us, because beach-glorious greater Wexford basically begins at the southern end of Wicklow Head, near our Roisin. But there's no ball games allowed and sod all kids about. We won't last long but just being outdoors is bliss enough for now. Our pitch is an unusually well-sheltered u-shape, with a wall at the back and four-foot wooden fence on either side, so we can wedge the jammer up against one fence and create a giant play pen for our daughter to run riot. Our set up is barely a step above the seasoned festival-goer. A four-man tent, folding table and chairs, and a gas stove. This year's big upgrade is a new air mattress, and the kids use it as a bouncy castle while my wife starts to cook up a Dekker Curry for the lads and lay the foundation for a long mellowyellow summer's evening. I scour the campsite for the bants and return with some local cycling knowlz from a father-and-son duo who kindly give me some levers for changing a tyre as I've forgotten to bring any.

It's a disgracefully cold 9 degrees when I wake up at 6 in the yA.M. and I'm not sure if the pains in my neck are because we forgot to bring pillows or because I was too lazy to lash on my scarf before bed. It feels like my body is already morphing into the physique of a rough sleeper and I'm reminded of why humans created so many creature comforts. I have to lash on my cycling jacket plus a windbreaker, but I'm on the road soon after seven, and my bike is much comfier since I raised the handlebars as I can actually reach them without having to do six months of yoga or, as it used to be called, stretching. I also forgot my cleated cycling shoes - I really need a checklist for packing - but my pedals swing both ways and one side works with my flat shoes, but I'm about 2k on the road when I remember I've left my spare tube buried in the car and I couldn't be Gordoned going back for it.

The southern coast of East Cork is very similar in its geography to West Waterford. Both are cliff-filled peninsula-like chunks of land, minus the pointiness, cut off from the main body of Ireland by sizeable bodies of water. The landmasses are separated by the wide Blackwater River at Youghal and today I'll be heading westwards for the enormous Cork Harbour. In both cases, the N25 road skirts across the top of the landmass, soaking up the traffic and keeping roads nice and quiet for exploring the various smaller peninsulas and bays along the coast. In terms of lighthouses, there is a need for a guidance light to help enter the harbours and a dramatic one to help ships avoid the entire landmass altogether. I've been to Youghal lighthouse already, on my way from Dungarvan Bay, and now I'm headed for Roche's Point, which marks the entry to the Cork Harbour. In between is the beautifully situated Ballycotton Lighthouse, on a tiny island off Ballycotton village, and there is also an unfinished, abandoned precursor lighthouse on Capel Island, just off Knockadoon point. It's only a few clicks out of the way so I decide to head there first and check it out.

I turn left out of the campsite and soon cross a bridge over the Womanagh River whose marshy estuary looks as pretty as can be in the cold but bright sunshine. I head for the little village of Ballymacoda where I'm delighted to find an upside-down map painted on the wall, oriented to highlight the important stuff to the tourist. The beaches to the left are actually east of the village, and the inaccessible little island is in the top-left corner, where I'm heading, south-east of here. Many years ago I tracked down an upside down map of the world and hung it on my wall. I probably got the idea from the anticlockwise clock that Leonard had in our gaff when we were in first year in college. Both take a bit of getting used to but I love being surrounded by things that subvert arbitrary convention because they remind you that world doesn't have to be this way. You don't always want your map with north at the top because that orientation may not best display the information you want to convey. Like with a piece of writing, you want to most important stuff in view at the top and the excess of detail hanging down the bottom of it.

It's a few easy clicks down towards little Knockadoon Pier which is little more than a gap in the mid-sized cliffs. I pull over, plonk my bike down by some tasteful roadside benches, and fail to make smalltalk with a quiet fisherman - I'm yet to meet any other kind - who is preparing a jam-packed kayak for a morning on the mellow sea. I stroll down towards the short, skinny pier to admire the view. Not far across the water is a pretty little island, drumlin-shaped, but nibbled around the edges like a biscuit belonging to a bored child. On top is an incomplete lighthouse which was being built when, the story goes, there was a shipwreck near Ballycotton Island and the lighthouse location was moved there, a choice helped by the fact that there had already been some debate over which island would be the best choice.

I take a few snaps and head back to my bike when the man, driven by helpful necessity, calls me and says he heard my tyre pop. I can't believe it. There's no glass on the ground. No thorns in my tyre. It just blew. Maybe I overpumped it. But along with leaving the spare tube in my car, I've not brung a repair kit cos I thought the spare would be enough. And now I'm stranded and kicking myself. It's 8am and I'm 10k from the campsite so I'm going to have to call my wife to rescue me, and disrupt their lazy Sunday morning. She doesn't answer so I text her the Jacques Chirac, knowing she'll at least be proud, with her new driving licence, to come and rescue me. The sort of get-out-of-jail card you don't want to play too often.

It takes me a while to realise that my irritation is just a gap between what I had planned for the day and what is available for me here. I'm in an extraordinarily beautiful place on a lovely sunny morning and a signpost tells me about the cliff walks all around, so I just accept my fate and decide to enjoy this scenic outpost. A notice explains a bit about the birds in the area and the fact that sea cliffs are the habitat least affected by human intervention, which is little surprise, given our struggles with the z-axis. The only ancient woodlands I have encountered in this country are all in valleys too steep to inhabit, notwithstanding the treehouses built by the Glen of the Downs protesters back in the David Norris.

The views along the cliff walk are outstanding, climaxing at an [abandoned stone signal](https://www.buildingsofireland.ie/buildings-search/building/20907820/knockadoon-co-cork) tower which boasts a panoramic view. In the distance to the east is the lonely Mine Head lighthouse, sat up high on its cliff, and to the west is a wide beachy bay leading to Ballycotton peninsula, with its island lighthouse. I mosey round the rest of the walk, about 3k in total, and I'm starting to worry I'll have to walk home, as my wife is yet to get back to me and maybe her phone is dead. I'm doing a bit of frantic Googling, looking for tube-fixing hacks, but the best I can find is to tie a knot around the severed part of the tube, pump it up as best as possible, and then bike-limp home. On my way back, I see a glut of teenagers are wandering around a little campus but they don't reply to my half-arsed efforts to get their attention. Eventually I find a older lad out with a vape, hanging out the back of it, and he explains, in his phat Dundalk accent, that he's one of thirty leaders looking after a hundred-odd teenagers on a summer camp. Mostly down from Dublin, Dundalk and Newry area, all of them somehow connected to the Dominicans who own this campus. Say what you want about the Catholic stranglehold on education in this country, but who else has the land to ship a hundred kids off to a seaside retreat?

Your man can't help me so I just chillax on the benches and lay into a brunch of crackers, cheese and nuts. My wife eventually text back to say she's found the tube in the car and will be on her way. It's a good chance to write up my notes and soon another fisherman-kayaker rocks up in a van and happens to have a spare tyre. Finally a yappy fisherman who is not wholly engrossed in his own world. My wife arrives two minutes later and is devo to find out that her heroism has been relegated to second place. But we have a laugh and settle down to some coffee from the camping stove, which she brought with her, along with a cardboard box for a pantry. Unfortunately, we can't completely chillax as the roaming zone for our daughter is a road and there's just enough traffic to wreck the buzz.

Sadly the map doesn't extend as far as Ballycotton to give a fuller picture of the eastern half of southern East Cork, and paint is a bit of a clumsy substance for

and one for ships to avoid the peninsula altogether. I've already been to Youghal Lighthouse and I'm aiming today to head for Roche's Point, which marks the entry to the en

I'm heading for Ballycotton but first Knockadoon, a little peninsula which is East Cork's answer to Helvick Head. On my way is

Exit strat (double job of packing & prepping the gaff for guests, which is frankly too much work). - We finally have the gaff up on Airbnb, which was job in itself and we get a biter, offering cash, so it's time to squash a tent and half the gaff into car and hit the Viking Raid (hit the Vico?). - They aren't due to come til Monday but i'm so impatient that I have to get out asap. Unemployment doesn't suit me and I've no writing to keep my spirits up, so I'm delira to be gonzo.

-   The night before we go, the bastids pull out on us
-   The journey isn't too punishing, two and half hours of N road on a diagonal across the Ancient South East, and on passing through in Youghal, my wife declares that this place could be the next Bray.
-   The campsite is 'like being in someone's back garden' and there's no space for kids to play.
-   The man who runs the campsite died a month ago and the wife and daughter are visibly shaken still, especially with last night's month's mind. Unsurprisingly there's no kids here but we do at least get a u-shaped unit in which we can keep our 17mo from running out and bein
-   

Route - Coast road from Youghal to Ballycotton, optional Knockadoon, Power Head hopefully and then on Roche's Point. Wife might pick me up in Whitegate or possibly even Cobh. - I'm delighted to scope out Youghal again but I'm not fussed about missing a wee bit of coastline between there and the campsite.

On the road - It's nine degrees outside - and in, cos we're in a tent - and I wake up with a bunch of pains in my neck. I'm not sure if it's cos we forgot pillows and had to use a folded up hand towel, or because I didn't wear a scarf in bed and my body is already morphing into the physique of a rough sleeper. - It's great to go back to basics and all but it doesn't take long to realise why we invented all of the so-called shite we surround ourselves with. - Thankfully, the bike is much comfier since I raised the handlebars so I can actually reach them without doing six months of flexibility work - I forgot my bike shoes and I really need a checklist for packing, until the routine is carved into my brain. - luckily some cyclists in the campsite gave me spare levers for changing a tyre, although I'm about 2k on the road when I remember I've forgotten my spare tube but I couldn't be Gordoned going back for it.

Knockadoon -\> Garryvoe, - Pic of bay + lighthouse island - This is Belgium, smell of cows, hedges, famrs, actual cows. Lowlumpy Ireland, less steep than Waterford, although that probably equates to a less interesting coastline? - view across bay + lovely little birthday cake island with a single candle on top.

-   Bad side of having family (or anyone really)
-   need to negotiate a viable spot now for Sharifa and the kids.
-   problem of having other stuff to worry about while on the bike. Organizational etc. I don't know if it's a bad thing or just a different thing, as it may be getting in the way
-   texting the boat tours people just in case they are heading out.
-   no bookings open on the website so the boat probably isn't fixed yet.

Garryvoe beach traders - 'healthy' semi-informal economy, coffee van, saunas and even a cake sale - I feellike all his low-barrier-to-entry economy is growing due to all the bolloxology brigade with their taxes & insurance and the need for décor and all that non-essential shite which drives up the price of everything in our overly complex society. - As for jobs again I feellike there is just too much complexity in everything. you need to know too much for many jobs and I couldn't be Gordoned getting o know it.

Ballycotton - tastefully decorated place with a bang of what I expect to exist in West Cork - colourful houses, pubs, cafes, buncha peeps having a shot at that world - Entertainment, something featuring Ronan Collins, and I realise that I'm going to keep more of an eye on the folk entertainment and places - cork house, Dublin techno, compare entertainment in Wexico - some kind of strong social indicator like churches.

Sit at the top of the harbour, looking over the island and imagining the lighthouse keepers doing Semaphore back to the family onshore. Maybe keep them up to date with the sport scores, like watching sport on Teletext where you'd keep refreshing the page to see if there were any updates. It'd be a full-time job for hurling fans though. Puck puck score. Puck puck score. Cork will beat Limerick later on today, by like 1-28 - 0-30, meaning the keeper's son would have had to make 59 signals over 70 minutes of action. At least there used to be fewere scores back in the day.
