East Cork

"Clonvilla is the definition of the middle of nowhere", says the fella on the phone from the mobile home park in Youghal which doesn't do tents. Very few spots in the municipal district of East Cork do tents and, if no one wants to go there, it suggests the landscape will be meh, at least by Ireland standards. There's another campsite closer to Cork city, in like *west* East cork?, but the reviews suggest it is a bit of a Brad Swiss, with zero facilities, and a motorway for a soundtrack. So Clonvilla it is. Plus I want to revisit scaldyball Youghal and continue my way round the coastline. I'd've stalled it down here a fortnight ago but the tourist boat out to Ballycotton lighthouse is banjoed and I've been waiting patiently for its resuscitation. But I've had enough now and I'm bringing the fam with me seeing as it school holiday time and our seven-year-old would only be sat at home, gamely twiddling his thumbs.

Plus we can now use Airbnb to pay for our holiday. Ish.

We spent the guts of the week prepping the Roisin to go up on the Airbnb website - clean and snap, clean and snap, for every room in the gaff - and then by the time we had guests booked, the whole gaff needed to be recleaned, with our existence being mostly airbrushed out. The whole task was multiplied in its difficulty by the steadfast burglarizing tekkerz of our seventeen-month-old daughter, a live entropy monster who can empty five cupboards faster than you can empty one dishwasher. The whole ordeal is agonizingly stressful, and henceforth we need to outsource the clean-up job, which is thing, according to Kilroy who regularly puts up his gaff when he gets out of Dodge. But once the gaff is in order, you're looking at a free holiday. A couple of spoofers book it and offer cash and I stupidly agree. We have the gaff like 80% ready to go on Friday night when they cancel via WhatsApp voice message. Something about Balbriggan being where the real value in the housing market lies. In the morning, neither of us has the emotional bandwidth to finish off the job and my wife just calls it, so we hit the proverbial at like half eleven, happy to run away from the unfinished mess, and we are in our East Cork campsite in time for a cheeky afternoon shower which clears the ground of any unwanted dust.

The campsite is tight and does indeed feel like camping in someone's back garden. There's fewer than thirty pitches, between static mobile homes and a handful of campervans and caravans passing through. No ball games allowed and no kids about. We won't last long. The place promotes itself as a stop-off point between the holiday hubs of West Cork and Wexford. Our pitch is an unusually well-sheltered u-shape, with a wall at the back and picket fence on either side, so we can jam the jammer up against one fence and create a giant play pen for our daughter to run riot. Our set up is barely a step above the seasoned festival-goer. A four-man tent, folding table and chairs, and a gas stove. This year's big upgrade is a new air mattress, and the kids use it as a bouncy castle while my wife starts to cook up a Dekker Curry for the lads. It's bliss to be outdoors and we get a great evening of it on our Tobler.

There's no real buzz about the place and the only people I get yapping to are a father-and-son cycling duo who spot me some bike levers for my trip in the morning as I forgot mine.

It's only nine degrees in the morning and I've got a bunch of pains in my neck. I'm not sure if it's cos we forgot pillows or because I forgot to wear my scarf in bed, and it feels like my body is already morphing into the physique of a rough sleeper. I'm reminded of why humans created so many creature comforts. I'm on the road nice and early and my bike is much comfier since I raised the handlebars as I can actually reach them without having to do six months of yoga or, as it used to be called, stretching. The only issue is that I forgot my cleated cycling shoes but my pedals swing both ways and one side works with my flat shoes, despite the slipping and loss of power.

It's quite sunny and I've a chance to admire

On the road - It's nine degrees outside - and in, cos we're in a tent - and I wake up with a bunch of pains in my neck. I'm not sure if it's cos we forgot pillows and had to use a folded up hand towel, or because I didn't wear a scarf in bed and my body is already morphing into the physique of a rough sleeper. - It's great to go back to basics and all but it doesn't take long to realise why we invented all of the so-called shite we surround ourselves with. - Thankfully, the bike is much comfier since I raised the handlebars so I can actually reach them without doing six months of flexibility work - I forgot my bike shoes and I really need a checklist for packing, until the routine is carved into my brain. - luckily some cyclists in the campsite gave me spare levers for changing a tyre, although I'm about 2k on the road when I remember I've forgotten my spare tube but I couldn't be Gordoned going back for it.

Exit strat (double job of packing & prepping the gaff for guests, which is frankly too much work). - We finally have the gaff up on Airbnb, which was job in itself and we get a biter, offering cash, so it's time to squash a tent and half the gaff into car and hit the Viking Raid (hit the Vico?). - They aren't due to come til Monday but i'm so impatient that I have to get out asap. Unemployment doesn't suit me and I've no writing to keep my spirits up, so I'm delira to be gonzo.

-   The night before we go, the bastids pull out on us
-   The journey isn't too punishing, two and half hours of N road on a diagonal across the Ancient South East, and on passing through in Youghal, my wife declares that this place could be the next Bray.
-   The campsite is 'like being in someone's back garden' and there's no space for kids to play.
-   The man who runs the campsite died a month ago and the wife and daughter are visibly shaken still, especially with last night's month's mind. Unsurprisingly there's no kids here but we do at least get a u-shaped unit in which we can keep our 17mo from running out and bein

Route - Coast road from Youghal to Ballycotton, optional Knockadoon, Power Head hopefully and then on Roche's Point. Wife might pick me up in Whitegate or possibly even Cobh. - I'm delighted to scope out Youghal again but I'm not fussed about missing a wee bit of coastline between there and the campsite.

Knockadoon - island shaped like a biscuit

Puncture repair / family bonds - with such poor public transport in this country, it's no surprise that #socialnetworks are so strong. \# - i'm used to fending for myself but this kind of emergency service is great.

Knockadoon - essentially just a steep road that goes into the sea. Tiny harbour for fishing, and a Dominican centre, populated in July by a hundred-odd teenagers out down from the Ancient North East, as you can tell from the banging knacker trance they play once

Knockadoon walk - sea cliffs most immune to human intervention, presumably because of our need for planar living - views both East and West, with Mine Head lighthouse on one side and Ballycotton on the other - easy to see why the confused Capel Island not Ballycotton,and I'd love to see the mathematics of how to choose them (cf Halpin overruling original recommendations).

-   people being a bit unfriendly.

-   Sharifa wondering if it's cos I'm a Dirty Dub, (or cos she might be a Gypo)

-   I point Sharifa to park in a tidy spot which turns out to be reserved for staff of the

-   what strikes me as odd is having formalized staff parking for a van shop (coffee / chipper, can't think of the word). \[BUILD THIS IDEA, INTRO HERE AND DEVELOP IT AT GARRYVOE\]

Knockadoon -\> Garryvoe, - Pic of bay + lighthouse island - This is Belgium, smell of cows, hedges, famrs, actual cows. Lowlumpy Ireland, less steep than Waterford, although that probably equates to a less interesting coastline? - view across bay + lovely little birthday cake island with a single candle on top.

-   Bad side of having family (or anyone really)
-   need to negotiate a viable spot now for Sharifa and the kids.
-   problem of having other stuff to worry about while on the bike. Organizational etc. I don't know if it's a bad thing or just a different thing, as it may be getting in the way
-   texting the boat tours people just in case they are heading out.
-   no bookings open on the website so the boat probably isn't fixed yet.

Garryvoe beach traders - 'healthy' semi-informal economy, coffee van, saunas and even a cake sale - I feellike all his low-barrier-to-entry economy is growing due to all the bolloxology brigade with their taxes & insurance and the need for d√©cor and all that non-essential shite which drives up the price of everything in our overly complex society. - As for jobs again I feellike there is just too much complexity in everything. you need to know too much for many jobs and I couldn't be Gordoned getting o know it.

Ballycotton - tastefully decorated place with a bang of what I expect to exist in West Cork - colourful houses, pubs, cafes, buncha peeps having a shot at that world - Entertainment, something featuring Ronan Collins, and I realise that I'm going to keep more of an eye on the folk entertainment and places - cork house, Dublin techno, compare entertainment in Wexico - some kind of strong social indicator like churches.

Sit at the top of the harbour, looking over the island and imagining the lighthouse keepers doing Semaphore back to the family onshore. Maybe keep them up to date with the sport scores, like watching sport on Teletext where you'd keep refreshing the page to see if there were any updates. It'd be a full-time job for hurling fans though. Puck puck score. Puck puck score. Cork will beat Limerick later on today, by like 1-28 - 0-30, meaning the keeper's son would have had to make 59 signals over 70 minutes of action. At least there used to be fewere scores back in the day.
