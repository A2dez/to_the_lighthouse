"Clonvilla is the definition of the middle of nowhere", says the fella on the phone from the mobile home park in Youghal which doesn't do tents. Very few spots in the municipal district of East Cork do tents and, if no one wants to holiday there, it suggests the coastline will be abitmeh, at least by Ireland standards. There's another campsite closer to Cork city, in like *¿west* East cork?, but the reviews suggest it is a bit of a Brad Swiss, with zero facilities, and a motorway for a soundtrack. So Clonvilla it is. Plus I want to revisit scaldyball Youghal and whence continue my way round the coastline. I'd've stalled it down here a fortnight ago but the tourist boat out to Ballycotton lighthouse is banjoed and I've been waiting patiently for its resuscitation. It's still not fixed and the owners said it might be back in action this weekend. But I've had enough now cos I wanna dunzo out this book, so I'm bringing the fam with me seeing as it school holiday time and our seven-year-old would only be sat at home, gamely twiddling his thumbs.

### No such thing as a free holiday

And not only are we off on our holiers, but we've got Airbnb guests paying for it. IsWe spent the guts of the week prepping the Roisin to go up on the Airbnb website - clean and snap, clean and snap, for every room in the gaff - and then by the time we had guests booked, the whole gaff needed to be recleaned, with our existence being largely airbrushed out slashtag wedged into cupboards. The whole task was multiplied in its difficulty by the steadfast burglarizing tekkerz of our seventeen-month-old daughter, a live entropy monster who can empty five cupboards faster than you can empty one dishwasher. The whole ordeal is agonizingly stressful, and henceforth we need to outsource the clean-up job, which is a thing, according to Kilroy who regularly puts up his gaff when he gets out of Dodge. But once the gaff is in order, you're looking at a free basically holiday. A couple of spoofers book it and offer cash and I stupidly agree. We have the gaff like 80% ready to go on Friday night when they cancel via WhatsApp voice message. Something about Balbriggan being where the real value in the housing market lies. In the morning, neither of us has the emotional bandwidth to finish off the job and my wife just calls it, so we jam half the gaff into the Boola Bogger and hit the proverbial at like half eleven, happy to run away from the unfinished mess. It's a single-shot drive to East Cork, but we pick up a wodge of camping gas in Dungarvan and then I'm oddly proud to show off Youghal to my wife and she declares it, in its natural beauty, to be the next Bray, when it's really still emerging from its Brayrut phase.

### Camping

![*Even with accommodation this luxurious, relaxation only comes when your toddler has a #safespace in which to cause carnage.*](images/clonvilla.jpeg)

We arrive in our campsite in time for a cheeky afternoon shower which clears the ground of any unwanted dust. The campsite is tight and does, as one reviewer suggests, feel like camping in someone's back garden. There's fewer than thirty pitches, between static mobile homes, caravans and campervans passing through, and a few of us third-class citizens in tents. The place promotes itself as a stop-off point between the holiday hubs of West Cork and Wexford, and that includes us, because beachglorious greater Wexford basically begins at the southern end of Wicklow Head, near our Roisin. But there's no ball games allowed and no kids about. We won't last long but just being outdoors is bliss enough for now. Our pitch is an unusually well-sheltered u-shape, with a wall at the back and four-foot picket fence on either side, so we can wedge the jammer up against one fence and create a giant play pen for our daughter to run riot. Our set up is barely a step above the seasoned festival-goer. A four-man tent, folding table and chairs, and a gas stove. This year's big upgrade is a new air mattress, and the kids use it as a bouncy castle while my wife starts to cook up a Dekker Curry for the lads and lay the foundation for a long, mellowyellow summer's evening. I crack open a warm one and scour the campsite for the bants. I return with some local cycling knowlz from a father-and-son duo who kindly give me some levers for changing a tyre as I've forgotten to bring any.

### Ballymacoda

![*Some German cyclists named Hansel and Gretel followed an obscure trail to this house in Ballymacoda...*](images/bike_people_ballymacoda.v01.jpg)

It's a disgracefully cold 9 degrees when I wake up at 6 in the yAy-M. and I'm not sure if the pains in my neck are because we forgot to bring pillows or because I was too lazy to lash on my scarf before bed. It feels like my body is already morphing into the physique of a rough sleeper and it's a reminder of why humans surround themselves with many creature comforts. I have to lash on my cycling jacket plus a windbreaker, but I'm on the road soon after seven, and my bike is much comfier since I raised the handlebars as I can actually reach them without having to do six months of yoga or, as it used to be called, stretching. I also forgot my cleated cycling shoes - I really need a checklist for packing - but my pedals swing both ways and one side works with my flat shoes. Then I'm about 2k on the road when I remember I've left my spare tube buried in the car and I couldn't be Gordoned going back for it.

The southern coast of East Cork is very similar in its geography to West Waterford. Both are cliff-filled peninsula-like chunks of land, minus the pointiness, cut off from the main body of Ireland by sizeable bodies of water. The landmasses are separated from each other by the wide Blackwater River at Youghal and today I'll be heading westwards for the enormous Cork Harbour. In both cases, the N25 road skirts across the top of the landmass, soaking up the traffic and keeping roads nice and quiet for exploring the various smaller peninsulas and bays along the coast. In terms of lighthouses, there is a need for a guidance light to help enter the harbours and a dramatic one to help ships avoid the entire landmass altogether. I've been to Youghal lighthouse already, on my way from Dungarvan Bay, and now I'm headed for Roche's Point, which marks the entry to the Cork Harbour. In between is the beautifully situated Ballycotton Lighthouse, on a tiny island off Ballycotton village, and there is also an unfinished, abandoned precursor lighthouse on Capel Island, just off Knockadoon point. It's only a few clicks out of the way so I decide to head there first and check it out.

![A painted map in Baile Mhic Óda (Ballymacoda) has been oriented with south at the top, in order to show off the important coastal features, with the uninteresting inland part fading off to irrelevance in the bottom right.](images/WhatsApp%20Image%202024-07-22%20at%2009.54.40.jpeg)

I turn left out of the campsite and soon cross a bridge over the Womanagh River whose marshy estuary looks as pretty as can be in the cold but bright sunshine. I head for the little village of Ballymacoda where I'm delighted to find an upside-down map painted on the wall, oriented to highlight the important stuff to the tourist. The beaches to the left are actually east of the village, and the inaccessible little island is in the top-left corner, where I'm heading, south-east of here. Many years ago I tracked down an upside down map of the world and hung it on my wall. I probably got the idea from the anticlockwise clock that Leonard had in our gaff when we were in first year in college. Both take a bit of getting used to but I love being surrounded by things that subvert arbitrary convention because they remind you that world doesn't have to be this way. You don't always want your map with north at the top because that orientation may not best display the information you want to convey. Like with a piece of writing, you want to most important stuff in view at the top and the excess of detail hanging down the bottom of it.

### Knockadoon & Capel Island

![*Capel Island has beauty baked into its shape but the truncated, unfinished lighthouse looks like a thorn from here.*](images/capel_island.jpeg)

It's a few easy clicks down towards little Knockadoon Pier which is little more than a gap in the mid-sized cliffs, with two perma-vans for coffee, ice cream and chips. I pull over, plonk my bike down by some tasteful roadside benches, and fail to make smalltalk with a quiet fisherman - I'm yet to meet any other kind - who is preparing a jam-packed kayak for a morning on the mellow sea. I stroll down towards the short, skinny pier to admire the view. A few football fields across the water is a pretty little island, drumlin-shaped, but nibbled around the edges like a biscuit belonging to a bored child. On top is an incomplete lighthouse which was being built when, the story goes, there was a shipwreck near Ballycotton Island and the lighthouse location was moved there, a choice helped by the fact that there had already been some debate over which island would be the best choice. But I bet there's good mathematical principles behind the choosing the optimal spot. Something to do with the positive swervation of the Earth's surface. Or like whatever.

![*Knockadoon Point is but a gap among the cliffs and its tiny cluster of activity is too small to be a village, containing just a boatslip, two food vans, a Dominican campus and a few well demarcated parking spots.*](images/knockadoon_point_2.jpeg)

I take a few snaps and head back to my bike when the man, driven by helpful necessity, calls me and says he heard my tyre pop. I can't believe it. There's no glass on the ground. No thorns in my tyre. It just blew. Maybe I overpumped it. But along with leaving the spare tube in my car, I've not brung a repair kit cos I thought the spare would be enough. And now I'm stranded and kicking myself. It's 8am and I'm 10k from the campsite so I'm going to have to call my wife to rescue me, and destroy their lazy holiday morning. She doesn't answer so I text her the Jacques Chirac, knowing she'll at least be proud, with her new driving licence, to come and rescue me. The sort of get-out-of-jail card you don't want to play too often.

![asdf](images/knockadoon_cliff_walks.jpeg)

It takes me a while to realise that my irritation is just the gap between what I had planned for the day and what is available for me here. I'm in an extraordinarily beautiful place on a lovely sunny morning and a signpost tells me about the cliff walks all around, so I just accept my fate and decide to enjoy this scenic outpost. A notice explains a bit about the birds in the area and the fact that sea cliffs are the habitat least affected by human intervention, which is little surprise, given our struggles with the z-axis. The only ancient woodlands I have encountered in this country are all in valleys too steep to inhabit, notwithstanding the treehouses built by the Glen of the Downs protesters back in the David Norris.

![*The lookout tower above Knockadoon Point doubled up as inspiration for several characters in Minecraft.*](images/minecraft_lookout.jpeg)

The views along the cliff walk are outstanding, climaxing at an [abandoned stone signal](https://www.buildingsofireland.ie/buildings-search/building/20907820/knockadoon-co-cork) tower which, apart from looking like a Minecraft character, boasts a panoramic view of the sea. Eighteen nautical miles from lonely Mine Head Lighthouse in Waterford, sat up high on its cliff, all the way across to the wide beachy bay leading to pointy Ballycotton village, with its islands and lighthouse. This tower dates from 1803 and was part of a network of signal towers built in response to the French efforts to land arms in Bantry Bay in 1796.[^ttl_19_ballycotton_rochespoint-1]

[^ttl_19_ballycotton_rochespoint-1]: <https://www.buildingsofireland.ie/buildings-search/building/20907820/knockadoon-co-cork>

I mosey round the rest of the walk, about 3k in total I'd say, and I'm starting to worry I'll have to walk home, as my wife is yet to get back to me and maybe her phone is brown bread. I'm doing a bit of frantic Googling, looking for tube-fixing hacks, but the best solution I can find is to tie a knot around the severed part of the tube, pump it up as best as possible, and then bike-limp home. On my way back, I see a cluster of teenagers wandering around a little campus but they don't reply to my half-arsed efforts to get their attention. Eventually I find a older lad out vaping on his Marcel Dobler, hanging out the back of it, and he explains, in his phat Dundalk accent, that he's one of thirty leaders looking after a hundred-odd teenagers on [a summer camp](https://knockadooncamp.ie/about/). Mostly down from Dublin, Dundalk and Newry area, all of them somehow connected to the Dominicans who own this campus. Say what you want about the Catholic stranglehold on education in this country, but who else has the assets to ship a hundred kids off to a glorious seaside retreat?

Your man can't help me so I just chillax on the benches and lay into a brunch of crackers, cheese and nuts. My wife eventually texts back to say she's found the tube in the car and will be on her way. It's a good chance to write up my notes and eventually another fisherman-kayaker rocks up in a van and happens to have a spare tube. Finally a yappy fisherman who is not wholly engrossed in his own world. My wife arrives two minutes later and is devo to find out that her heroism has been relegated to second place, as I'm already changing the tube. But we have a laugh and eventually settle down for some coffee from the camping stove, which she brought with her, along with a cardboard box for a pantry.

It's a curious atmosphere, where everyone has multiple roles. I'm now mixing parent and husband with explorer cyclist, interrupting fun with the family to drain local knowledge out of punters. Meanwhile, my wife is sniffing out the peeps to work out their collective mood. Any excuse for cheap conflict is her analysis, and, with my bike fixed, we eventually hit the Dermot, me for Ballycotton and the others for a beach along the way.

### Garryvoe

![*From up high in the fields above Garryvoe Beach, a clear view can be had of Ballycotton Lighthouse on the lumpy Outer Island (left), flat Inner Island (middle), and the peninsular Ballycotton village (right).*](images/ballycotton_islands_from_garryvoe.jpeg)

It's a 20k spin from here to there and there first ten clicks are just classic *This is Belgium* territory. Back roads with nothing happening. Typical lowlumpy Ireland. Nothing too flat and nothing too steep. The smell of cows. Hedges. Farms. Actual cows, chillaxing under the shade. It's time for my mind to wander and to contemplate how happy I am that my family are at long last on my cycle. Yet their well-being is nagging at me because we didn't agree on the next stop and that's now clogging up my mental bandwidth. It's another reminder of why travel writing requires selfishness. If you're responsible to anything at all, you're not doing your job. It gets me a few sentences here, but that's hardly repeatable material. Any future collaboration will require clarity in our roles. Sometimes, behind the hedges, the view across the bay emerges, and Ballycotton Island looks like a lovely little birthday cake with a single candle on top. I'm trying to get there by 12 noon in case the lighthouse tour is back on, and I text them to let them know I'll be there in the nick of time, #justincasey.

I take a wrong turn before Garryvoe and as I'm doing a U-turn, I bump into my family, taking the same wrong turn. It turns out they are heading to the beach there so I agree to meet them there after I'm done. Which means Roche's Point Lighthouse will have to wait another day. I nip down to the beach, before them somehow, and have a quick goo at the multiple vendors along the long car park. Coffee, ice cream and chips, like anywhere. A wee cake sale run by possibly retired ladies. Someone selling trinkety gifts. A sauna. I feellike all this low-barrier-to-entry economy is growing due to all the bolloxology that comes with setting up a business. Taxes & insurance and the need for décor and all that non-essential shite which drives up the price of everything in our overly complex society. It reminds me of my own unemployment and the complexity of most jobs. You need to know so much for many jobs and I couldn't be Gordoned getting to know more. The problem about getting another job in AI slash machine learning is that you're up against cleverer, eagerer, annoyinger young people, with fully-functioning brains, and you have to keep on learning. I wentahead and mastered R and data visualization and how to babysit a machine learning model in production. But now it has to be python and interactive dashboards and large language models, and I just couldn't be arsed. Learning to code was interesting and helpful but I don't like it enough to frikkin re-learn it and re-update myself, as though I am the computer. I really don't know what I'm going to do for a living but sacrificing my existence to that world, all for an extra grand a month, isn't how I want to live.

It's in this state of panic that I complete the remaining 7k to Ballycotton via Shanagarry. En route I pass by a *Kilkenny Design* shop and I'm surprised that such a small place would have such a large store. But rural Ireland is smattered with sundry gems that can only survive by drawing in punters from afar. The situation is explained a bit when I see a sign for Ballymaloe Cookery school, which I first encountered as a child through Darina Allen's *Simply Delicious* TV show, a curiosity wherein someone actually cared about the components of their food, unlike anyone who made food I was exposed to. I remember Reggie White first and Jasper O'Connor later on both going there for like a summer of intensive cooking and then landing themselves jobs in kitchens Pat Rafterwards, thence forging successful careers in that field. That was like peak recession era, when Reggie's short-live career as an estate agent on a moped went tits understandably up, while Jasper was just one of many Orts Degree peers who had no useful skills for which anyone might actually give them money. Before then, it'd be me who'd cook whopper roasts for a dozen people, a labour of love that has fizzled out of my life, and now I am about to cycle past this scran hub in a hurry. Seemingly, we could book a five-course meal in Ballymaloe House, but dinner in a chipper is enough of a struggle when you've got a one-year-old in tow.

The beach that started in Garryvoe has tracked me all the way to Ballycotton where I'm met by a wedge-shaped village on a rock, with houses painted in garish slabs of colour that harmonise somewhat to brighten up this rain-sodden island of greygreen misery. A small crowd gawk at me from a cafe which has squatted an old church. A number of gastrojuicers bounce out of the long, narrow main street where moving cars take turns to jostle past parked ones, while pedestrian families must wend through any gaps, like roadspace scavengers. Eventually the road forks and leads to the harbour down below and a few football-pitches of low-tide rocks between here and the delicioso island lighthouse.

I'm delighted to see the effort but it reminds me of the Irish tendency to be the best behaved child in the class, with li

Sit at the top of the harbour, looking over the island and imagining the lighthouse keepers doing Semaphore back to the family onshore. Maybe keep them up to date with the sport scores, like watching sport on Teletext where you'd keep refreshing the page to see if there were any updates. It'd be a full-time job for hurling fans though. Puck puck score. Puck puck score. Cork will beat Limerick later on today, by like 1-28 - 0-30, meaning the keeper's son would have had to make 59 signals over 70 minutes of action. At least there used to be fewere scores back in the day.
