East Cork

"Clonvilla is the definition of the middle of nowhere", says the fella on the phone from the mobile home park in Youghal which doesn't do tents. Very few spots in the municipal district of East Cork do tents and, if no one wants to holiday there, it suggests the coastline will be meh, at least by Ireland standards. There's another campsite closer to Cork city, in like *west* East cork?, but the reviews suggest it is a bit of a Brad Swiss, with zero facilities, and a motorway for a soundtrack. So Clonvilla it is. Plus I want to revisit scaldyball Youghal and continue my way round the coastline. I'd've stalled it down here a fortnight ago but the tourist boat out to Ballycotton lighthouse is banjoed and I've been waiting patiently for its resuscitation. It's still not fixed by I've had enough now and I'm bringing the fam with me seeing as it school holiday time and our seven-year-old would only be sat at home, gamely twiddling his thumbs.

Plus we can now use Airbnb to pay for our holiday. Ish.

We spent the guts of the week prepping the Roisin to go up on the Airbnb website - clean and snap, clean and snap, for every room in the gaff - and then by the time we had guests booked, the whole gaff needed to be recleaned, with our existence being mostly airbrushed out. The whole task was multiplied in its difficulty by the steadfast burglarizing tekkerz of our seventeen-month-old daughter, a live entropy monster who can empty five cupboards faster than you can empty one dishwasher. The whole ordeal is agonizingly stressful, and henceforth we need to outsource the clean-up job, which is thing, according to Kilroy who regularly puts up his gaff when he gets out of Dodge. But once the gaff is in order, you're looking at a free holiday. A couple of spoofers book it and offer cash and I stupidly agree. We have the gaff like 80% ready to go on Friday night when they cancel via WhatsApp voice message. Something about Balbriggan being where the real value in the housing market lies. In the morning, neither of us has the emotional bandwidth to finish off the job and my wife just calls it, so we hit the proverbial at like half eleven, happy to run away from the unfinished mess, and we are in our East Cork campsite in time for a cheeky afternoon shower which clears the ground of any unwanted dust.

The campsite is tight and does indeed feel like camping in someone's back garden. There's fewer than thirty pitches, between static mobile homes and a handful of campervans and caravans passing through. No ball games allowed and no kids about. We won't last long but just being outdoors is enough for now. The place promotes itself as a stop-off point between the holiday hubs of West Cork and Wexford. Our pitch is an unusually well-sheltered u-shape, with a wall at the back and picket fence on either side, so we can jam the jammer up against one fence and create a giant play pen for our daughter to run riot. Our set up is barely a step above the seasoned festival-goer. A four-man tent, folding table and chairs, and a gas stove. This year's big upgrade is a new air mattress, and the kids use it as a bouncy castle while my wife starts to cook up a Dekker Curry for the lads. It's bliss to be outdoors and we get a great evening of it on our Tobler.

There's no real buzz about the place and the only people I get yapping to are a father-and-son cycling duo who spot me some bike levers for my trip in the morning as I forgot mine.

I wake up with a bunch of pains in my neck and I'm not sure if it's cos we forgot pillows or because I forgot to wear my scarf in bed, and it feels like my body is already morphing into the physique of a rough sleeper. I'm reminded of why humans created so many creature comforts. It's only nine degrees, which is unacceptable in July, even in the morning, so I have to lash on my cycling jacket plus a windbreaker, but I'm on the road soon after seven, and my bike is much comfier since I raised the handlebars as I can actually reach them without having to do six months of yoga or, as it used to be called, stretching. I forgot my cleated cycling shoes - I really need a checklist for packing - but my pedals swing both ways and one side works with my flat shoes, despite the loss of power and constant slipping of my soles.

luckily some cyclists in the campsite gave me spare levers for changing a tyre, although I'm about 2k on the road when I remember I've forgotten my spare tube but I couldn't be Gordoned going back for it.

The southern coast of East Cork is very similar in its geography to the adjacent West Waterford. Both are peninsula-like chunks of land, minus the pointiness, cut off from the main body of Ireland by sizeable bodies of water. The landmasses are separated by the Blackwater RIver at Youghal and today I'll be heading westwards for the enormous Cork Harbour. In both cases, the N25 road skirts across the top of the landmass, soaking up the traffic and keeping roads nice and quiet for cyclists to explore the various smaller peninsulas and bays along the coast. In terms of lighthouses, there is a need for a functional one to enter each body of water and a dramatic one to help ships avoid the entire landmass altogether. I've been to Youghal lighthouse already, on my way from Dungarvan Bay, and now I'm headed for Roche's Point, which marks the entry to the Cork Harbour. In between is the beautifully situated Ballycotton Lighthouse, on a tiny island a few hundred metres from Ballycotton village, and there is also an unfinished, abandoned precursor lighthouse on Capel Island, a few football fields from Knockadoon point. It's only a few clicks out of the way so I decide to head there first and check it out.

I turn left out of the campsite and soon cross a bridge over the Womanagh River whose marshy estuary looks as pretty as can be in the cold but bright sunshine. I head for the little village of Ballymacoda where I find an upside-down map painted on the wall, oriented to highlight the important stuff to the tourist. The beaches to the left are actually east of the village, and the inaccessible little island is in the top-left corner, where I'm heading, south-east of here. Many years ago I tracked down and upside down map of the world and hung it on my wall. I probably got the idea from the anticlockwise clock that Leonard had in our gaff when we were in first year in college. Both take a bit of getting used to but I love being surrounded by things that subvert arbitrary convention because they remind you that world doesn't have to be this way. You don't always want your map with north at the top because that orientation may not best display the information you want to convey. Like with a piece of writing, you want to most important stuff in view at the top and the excess of detail hanging down the bottom of it.

I descend towards the pier area where some tasteful seating sit at the side of the road. It's a shopless hamlet with space for a few boats and little else, bar a Dominican Centre which is currently occupied by teenagers at a summer camp. I mosey down to gaze at the pretty Capel Island, a

Sadly the map doesn't extend as far as Ballycotton to give a fuller picture of the eastern half of southern East Cork, and paint is a bit of a clumsy substance for

and one for ships to avoid the peninsula altogether. I've already been to Youghal Lighthouse and I'm aiming today to head for Roche's Point, which marks the entry to the en

I'm heading for Ballycotton but first Knockadoon, a little peninsula which is East Cork's answer to Helvick Head. On my way is

. Both have

Exit strat (double job of packing & prepping the gaff for guests, which is frankly too much work). - We finally have the gaff up on Airbnb, which was job in itself and we get a biter, offering cash, so it's time to squash a tent and half the gaff into car and hit the Viking Raid (hit the Vico?). - They aren't due to come til Monday but i'm so impatient that I have to get out asap. Unemployment doesn't suit me and I've no writing to keep my spirits up, so I'm delira to be gonzo.

-   The night before we go, the bastids pull out on us
-   The journey isn't too punishing, two and half hours of N road on a diagonal across the Ancient South East, and on passing through in Youghal, my wife declares that this place could be the next Bray.
-   The campsite is 'like being in someone's back garden' and there's no space for kids to play.
-   The man who runs the campsite died a month ago and the wife and daughter are visibly shaken still, especially with last night's month's mind. Unsurprisingly there's no kids here but we do at least get a u-shaped unit in which we can keep our 17mo from running out and bein
-   

Route - Coast road from Youghal to Ballycotton, optional Knockadoon, Power Head hopefully and then on Roche's Point. Wife might pick me up in Whitegate or possibly even Cobh. - I'm delighted to scope out Youghal again but I'm not fussed about missing a wee bit of coastline between there and the campsite.

On the road - It's nine degrees outside - and in, cos we're in a tent - and I wake up with a bunch of pains in my neck. I'm not sure if it's cos we forgot pillows and had to use a folded up hand towel, or because I didn't wear a scarf in bed and my body is already morphing into the physique of a rough sleeper. - It's great to go back to basics and all but it doesn't take long to realise why we invented all of the so-called shite we surround ourselves with. - Thankfully, the bike is much comfier since I raised the handlebars so I can actually reach them without doing six months of flexibility work - I forgot my bike shoes and I really need a checklist for packing, until the routine is carved into my brain. - luckily some cyclists in the campsite gave me spare levers for changing a tyre, although I'm about 2k on the road when I remember I've forgotten my spare tube but I couldn't be Gordoned going back for it.

Knockadoon -\> Garryvoe, - Pic of bay + lighthouse island - This is Belgium, smell of cows, hedges, famrs, actual cows. Lowlumpy Ireland, less steep than Waterford, although that probably equates to a less interesting coastline? - view across bay + lovely little birthday cake island with a single candle on top.

-   Bad side of having family (or anyone really)
-   need to negotiate a viable spot now for Sharifa and the kids.
-   problem of having other stuff to worry about while on the bike. Organizational etc. I don't know if it's a bad thing or just a different thing, as it may be getting in the way
-   texting the boat tours people just in case they are heading out.
-   no bookings open on the website so the boat probably isn't fixed yet.

Garryvoe beach traders - 'healthy' semi-informal economy, coffee van, saunas and even a cake sale - I feellike all his low-barrier-to-entry economy is growing due to all the bolloxology brigade with their taxes & insurance and the need for décor and all that non-essential shite which drives up the price of everything in our overly complex society. - As for jobs again I feellike there is just too much complexity in everything. you need to know too much for many jobs and I couldn't be Gordoned getting o know it.

Ballycotton - tastefully decorated place with a bang of what I expect to exist in West Cork - colourful houses, pubs, cafes, buncha peeps having a shot at that world - Entertainment, something featuring Ronan Collins, and I realise that I'm going to keep more of an eye on the folk entertainment and places - cork house, Dublin techno, compare entertainment in Wexico - some kind of strong social indicator like churches.

Sit at the top of the harbour, looking over the island and imagining the lighthouse keepers doing Semaphore back to the family onshore. Maybe keep them up to date with the sport scores, like watching sport on Teletext where you'd keep refreshing the page to see if there were any updates. It'd be a full-time job for hurling fans though. Puck puck score. Puck puck score. Cork will beat Limerick later on today, by like 1-28 - 0-30, meaning the keeper's son would have had to make 59 signals over 70 minutes of action. At least there used to be fewere scores back in the day.
