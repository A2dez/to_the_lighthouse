#### **0759, Sunday 28 Aug, 2022**

It was not my intention to cycle to Poolbeg Lighthouse today, or any other lighthouses for that matter. And I certainly wasn't planning on starting any books. I just needed to get the flock out of the gaff and clear my head. The plan was to do a re-run of yesterdo's cycle, stalling in from my gaff in Blanch to Grand Canal Dock, where I would aim for another dark coffee and bright pastry in *Il Valentino*, and handwrite about that joyous trip. But I'm way too whimsical to do identikit journeys, so as I come out of my crap apartment block, I turn right instead of yesterday's left, and hit the River Liffey where I can catch some Vitamin Tree.

I'm blessed that there's a wodge of ways into town from my gaff cos my vision of hell is to go up and down the same road every day. While Blanchardstown itself is mostly devoid of geography, it sits between two fine cycle routes. There is a canal path circling the inner Northside and it drops you off at various points about one click from the Spire. After that you're on your own, mate. To the south is the Phoenix Park, a gentle decline into town, and a miserable drag home. But the most beautiful route of all is a mild detour via the River Liffey. All I have to do is drop a quick perpendicular through a buncha shitbox housing estates, and take the riverrun along the Strawberry Beds, snaking through Chapelizard, pushing past Islandbridge and Heuston Station, and emerging, foetus-like, out of the quickening cocoon and into the great wide open of the city and the sea.

### Sunrise Fomo

It's a cloudy-ass day today but as I cross a dull suburban bridge towards the bleakly named Diswellstown, I see a patch of sunlight in the distance and I get a fierce dose of sunrise fomo, so I decide to chase it, along the river and east to the sea and sun. Not long ago I saw a patch of post-sunrise beauty over in Cabra slash the Navan Road. I elected not to stop and take photos as it would hinder my cycling rhythm, and I've been chasing that light ever since. Now Sunny Cabra is not known for its beauty, but when you are cycling along the Navan road, downhill into town, and the stars are aligned, the place lights up like an afterparty in Ibiza, and you can see how this proto-dual-carriageway slash dynamic car park, which is actually lined with incongruently large houses, may have once been a broad avenue of trees, horses and opulent outdoor breakfasts. Today wasn't quite one of those days, but there was enough sun to give me some morning glowry, and I ached to get closter to that blob of nice light in the sea of grey clouds above.

### Liffey Valley

First though I had to get to the river, down Rugged Lane which might be County Dublin's strongest candidate for becoming a one-way road. It's a moderately steep valley descent, about the width of a big van, and the only way through is to pull in to the occasional driveways and let the other motorists pass. The potholes are like something from the 1980s and even cycling it is bumpy wumpy, then at the bottom is the Strawberry Beds, a gently meandering, tree-lined riverroad with ramps to keep the cars away. Back in the Doris, motorcyclists would zip along here and stop off in *The Wren's Nest* pub, but the ramps are doing their job so now so it's a near-perfect commute for a cyclist, winding through dense foliage, past scattered houses and cottage clusters, with the river itself coming in and out of view. The houses all back up on to the valley but a couple have treeless gardens on the river side of the road, a view of the sun and the valley across the river.

The road begins in Lucan village and the end is marked by a gastropub called *The Angler's Res*t, angled along Knockmaroon Hill, just before the back entrance to the Phoenix Park. For me, the real boozer is *The Strawberry Hall*, underneath the M50 Toll Bridge, which has no telly and used to only take cash. Just pints and chat. In recent years a pop-up pizza parlour has popped up in the car park across the road and if you are feeling adventurous you can swim in the river, accessed by a mud beach about the width of wide van. I've never seshed in the boozer of an evening, although I've often stopped off for a scoop while cycling home home to Lucan, and sat outside, facing the sun. I used to often commute this beautiful road from Lucan village to Chapelizod, especially while my elderly parents had the good fortune of housing me between the age of 34 and 36, along with my wife and child. A cycle path could be put in all the way to town, ideally crossing over the river to the wondrous new Waterstown Park in Palmerstown, on the south side of the Liffey Valley. It's a solid commute, but in a world of e-bikes, scooters and foldable bicycles, it's legit feasible to trek it one way and take the boola bus for the other. I used to cycle in one day and bus it home of an evening, then the next day I'd do the reverse. It was a neat pattern until my bike got obviously stolen in town. My vision is that we'll develop one long greenway running from Leixlip through Lucan demesne and village, across the river to Palmerstown, and then through Chapelizod and Islandbridge. This is the ancient route to Galway, with villages all along, and now we just need to connect the dots and take advantage of this under-appreciated natural path.

### Reflections

I climb up the shallower side of Knockmaroon hill, past The Anglers' Rest and then down the short, steep descent into bumpy, rampy Chapelizod, a and never an easy passage for cyclists. I spent a lot of time here during the miserable Level 5 Covid days, getting a takeaway coffee from Baa Baas, and sitting down with my laptop and a blanket outside the Villager Pub on its permabenches. The village is tiny but it has a great energy, as the locals live right in it and there's a never-ending parade of passers-by, between M50 toll-dodgers and Phoenix Park walkers accessing the giant park via the Twirly Gate, after which the other cafe is named. I turn right across the bridge and chicane left soon afterwards through some houses and I think of poor Rob Carnegie who passed away a few years ago. I used to play cricket in the Park with him and his big brother Jamie, and then I bumped into old John Doran one day - on my way to see the Pope in fact - and he told me that Rob had died in an accident. I don't know which is his home so I've never been in to pay my respects to the parents, assuming they themselves are still alive.

Access to the south side of the river is behind one of those bicycle-hating barriers so you have to dismount and verticalize your bike just to get through, but after that it's free ride on a footpath with bicycles stencilled onto it. I didn't know about this path for years until Mick Barton filled me and I've been using it ever since because parallel Conyngham road is pretty drab by comparison. I stop and take a few snaps of a riverbank whose leafy round undersides bounc back out of the river, and I reflect on how anything irregular can be made beautiful simply by mirroring it. How anything irregular can be made beautiful by simply mirroring it.

I mosey on towards Islandbridge, via the War memorial gardens, and I see a triathlon centred around one of the rowing clubs. I think about investigating it, seeing as I have been thinking about a) doing triathlons, and b) reporting on random events, but I thought better of it as I remember that my actual goal is to talk shite about my own journeys, and I'll start reporting about other people's once that project runs out of juice.

So that has me on Conyngham Road approaching Parkgate St and another of my favourite views in Dear Dirty Dzublin, the quays on a bright day. Or, as it was today, light at the end of the river, with grey clouds all around, as though the buildings had a blurred reflection in the sky. Finally I was en route to the sunlight so I kept going, towards Grand Canal Dock, as planned, although there was a random car parked on Ellis Quay, unmanned, and with its hazard lights flashing, so I stopped and called the cops, cos God only knows what was going on. The quays did their thing after that, opening up into the broader docks, with the water and sky casting redyellowblue joy onto the grey city, and the big buildings being pleasingly far away from another, leaving space for the soul to breathe, like they do in Berlin. 

So I decide to chase the light instead of stopping for coffee in Grand Canal, although I felt like the proverbial dog chasing after a bicycle, as the sky faded to grey. I cross over the scaldyball East Link Toll bridge, a rundown beggar of a road that ought to be ashamed of itself for asking people to pay to cross it. It is rare reminder of the visual state of Ireland back in the 1990s, like [looking at the moustaches in the Walkinstown Roundabout video after we beat Romania in Italia 90](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEkc8dGF2ds&pp=ygUgd2Fsa2luc3Rvd24gcm91bmRhYm91dCBpdGFsaWEgOTA%3D). 

Yet its griminess bled neatly into Dublin Port which I had to wind through for a click or two, past the disused Ice Cream Factory, officially known as the Poolbeg Chimneys, and on to the Poolbeg Lighthouse, via the Great South Wall, a 2k stretch of fat cobblestones that made me feel like I was soloing to victory in Paris-Roubaix like Dylan van Baarle.
