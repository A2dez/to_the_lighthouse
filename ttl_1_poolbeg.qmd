#### **0759, Sunday 28 Aug, 2022**

It was not my intention to cycle to Poolbeg Lighthouse today, or any other lighthouses for that matter. And I certainly wasn't planning on starting any books. I just needed to get the flock out of the gaff and clear my head. The plan was to do a re-run of yesterday's cycle, stalling in from my gaff in Blanch to Grand Canal Dock, where I would aim for another dark coffee and bright pastry in *Il Valentino*, and write about yesterdo's joyous trip. But J'm way too whimsical to do identikit journeys, so as I came out of my crap apartment block, I turned right instead of yesterday's left, and hit the River Liffey where I can catch some Vitamin Tree. I'm blessed that there's a wodge of ways into town from my gaff cos my vision of hell is to go up and down the same road every day. While Blanchardstown itself is mostly devoid of geography, it sits between two fine cycle routes. There is a canal path circling the inner Northside and it drops you off at various points about one click from the Spire. After that you're on your own, mate. To the south is the Phoenix Park, a gentle decline into town, and a miserable drag home. But the most beautiful route of all is a mild detour via the River Liffey. All I have to do is drop a quick perpendicular through a buncha shitbox housing estates, and take the riverrun along the Strawberry Beds, snaking through Chapelizard, pushing past Islandbridge and Heuston Station, and emerging, foetus-like, out of the suburban cocoon and into the great wide open of the city and the sea.

### Sunrise Fomo

It's a cloudy-ass day today but as I cross a dull suburban bridge towards the bleakly named Diswellstown, I see a patch of sunlight in the distance and I get a fierce dose of sunrise fomo, so I decide to chase it, along the river and east to the sea and sun. Not long ago I saw a patch of post-sunrise beauty over in Sunny Cabra slash the Navan Road. I elected not to stop and take photos as it would hinder my cycling rhythm, and I've been chasing it since. Now Cabra is not known for its beauty, but when you are cycling along the Navan road, downhill into town, and the stars are aligned, the place lights up like an afterparty in Ibiza, and you can see how this proto-dual-carriageway slash dynamic car park, which is actually lined with incongruently large houses, may have once been a broad avenue of trees, horses and opulent outdoor breakfasts. Today wasn't quite one of those days, but there was enough sun to give me some morning glowry, and I ached to see that blob of nice light to my distant left in the sea of grey clouds above.

### Liffey Valley

First though I had to get to the river, down Rugged Lane which might be probably County Dublin's strongest candidate for becoming a one-way road. It's a moderately steep valley descent, about the width of a big van, and the only way through is to pull in to someone's driveway and let the other motorist past. The potholes are like something from the 1980s and even cycling it is treacherous, but at the bottom is the Strawberry Beds, a gently meandering tree-lined road with ramps to keep the cars away. Back in the Doris, motorcyclists would zip along here and stop off in The Wren's Nest pub, but the ramps keep them away now so it's the perfect commute for a cyclist. On Knockmaroon Hill is a gastropub called *The Angler's Res*t but the real boozer is *The Strawberry Hall*, underneath the M50 Toll Bridge, and it's the kind of place that has no telly and used to only take cash. In recent years a pop-up restaurant has popped up across the road and if you are feeling adventurous you can swim in the river, accessed by a mud beach about the length of lorry. I've never seshed in the boozer of an evening, although I've often stopped off for a scoop while cycling home home to Lucan, on its south-facing outdoor seating. My parents had the good fortune of housing me between the age of 34 and 36, along with my wife and child, and I'd often commute this beautiful road from Lucan village to Chapelizod. A cycle path should be put in all the way to town, ideally crossing over the river to the wondrous new Waterstown Park in Palmerstown, on the south side of the Liffey Valley. It's a solid distance, but in a world of e-bikes, scooters and foldable bicycles, it's completely feasible to trek it for one leg and take the boola bus for the other. I used to cycle in one day and bus it home of an evening, then the next day I'd do the reverse. It was a great pattern until my bike got obviously stolen in town. But my vision is that we'll have one long greenway running from Leixlip through Lucan demesne, Palmerstown, Chapelizod and Islandbridge. There's already a series of villages along this ancient route - this used to be the road to Galway - and now we just need to connect the dots and take advantage of this under-appreciated natural path.

I climb up the shallower side of Knockmaroon hill, past The Anglers' Rest and a back entrance to the Phoenix Park is on the crest of the hill, beside Mount Anville. There's a very steep descent into bumpy, rampy Chapelizod, a second-gear village in driving terms, and then a chicane-bridge over the Liffey onto a proper cycle path on the south side of the river

I moseyed on inanyways towards Islandbridge and I took a few snaps of a riverbank whose leafy round undersides bounced back out of the river, and I reflected on how anything irregular can be made beautiful simply by mirroring it. How anything irregular can be made beautiful by simply mirroring it.

There was a triathlon centred around one of the rowing clubs too and I thought about investigating it, seeing as I have been thinking about a) doing triathlons, and b) reporting on random events, but I thought better of it as I remembered that my actual goal is to talk shite about my own journeys, and I'll start reporting about other people's once that project runs out of juice. So that had me on Conyngham Road approaching Parkgate St and another of my favourite views in Dear Dirty Dzublin, the quays on a bright day. Or, as it was today, light at the end of the river, with grey clouds all around, as though the buildings had a blurred reflection in the sky. Finally I was en route to the sunlight so I kept going, towards Grand Canal Dock, as planned, although there was a random car parked on Ellis Quay, unmanned, and with its hazard lights flashing, so I stopped and called the cops, cos God only knows what was going on. The quays did their thing after that, opening up into the broader docks, with the water and sky casting redyellowblue joy onto the grey city, and the big buildings being pleasingly far away from another, leaving space for the soul to breathe, like they do in Berlin. 

So I decided to chase the light instead of stopping for coffee in Grand Canal, although I felt like the proverbial dog chasing after a bicycle, as sky faded to grey. I crossed over the scaldyball East Link Toll bridge, a rundown beggar of a road that ought to be ashamed of itself for asking people to pay to cross it. It is rare reminder of the visual state of Ireland back in the 1990s, like looking at the moustaches in the Walkinstown Roundabout video after we beat Romania in Italia 90. 

Yet its griminess bled neatly into Dublin Port which I had to wind through for a click or two, past the disused Ice Cream Factory, officially known as the Poolbeg Chimneys, and on to the Poolbeg Lighthouse, via the Great South Wall, a 2k strech of fat cobblestones leading that made me feel like I was soloing to victory in Paris-Roubaix.

On my way to the river I decide to check out some of the housing estates, partly to see if I can find detours and partly to see if any of them are worth living in. We need to buy our own gaff and preferably soon because we are funnelling twenty grand a year into someone else's bank account. The t\

a familiar route to me. Stall it south via a buncha gaffs and roads, down to
