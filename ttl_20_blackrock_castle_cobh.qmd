![*Blackrock Castle near Cork City.*](images/blackrock_castle_20240809_102859.jpg)

I got in to Cork City at like half ten last night, parked up outside St Patrick's Church, and then kipped in a dorm room in Sheila's Hostel, a well-run spot. As soon as I got to the hostel I was to text my wife **– which I did, tobefairtome –** to confirm that the place wasn't a basically homeless shelter, cos you wouldn't know these days. I'm half embarrassed to be in a Sonic Youth hostel at my age but I remember from my galavanting pisshead days that there were always a few oddball cyclists kipping in hostels, sober and old, in need of a cheap mattress and an early exit. I'm actually surprised to see how many people my age or older are floating about, between muinteoir types leading teenage groups, and just a few, ifwe'rehonest, weirdos. Little else has changed in the eleven years since I was last in one of these places. Giddy reception staff. Tiny unisex bathrooms. People planning out their trips of an evening. An emotional guitarist. Luckily there's no bar in this one. In my room, everyone's conkers when I climb up the creaking ladder into my top bunk. The bed has a ledge welded onto it with a USB port and I reflect with delight that that is the only notable difference since the last time I was in one of these places, back in like 2013. Wouldn't it be so soothing if we could chillax and maintain such a glacial level of technological progress over the remaining few decades of my expected life. I wake up at half three having a nightmare about being squashed among dozens of people in a maybe gas chamber. The dorm room turns out to be windowless and thus airless. I get out of the Margaret, hit the Soviet, and notice that another room's door is being wedged open with a bin. So I do the same for mine and kip away til half six when the loudest person in the world wakes me up, rolling a needlessly cigarette in the dark, on his bed, like a prisoner.

Cork City is near empty at 7am, but Bus Stop Coffee on Patrick's Quay is open and the owner is a good match for sprightly me. The Olympics are still on and he's telling me all about the Pakistani fella who won the javelin there last night, one of just six athletes from that country. My favourite story is of the Afghan sisters who fled their country before the Taliban came back in to power and now they are in the Cycling Road Race, and both even made the early breakaway. We reminisce about watching the Barcelona Olympics as kids, him with tonsillitis and the family's black-and-white telly in his bedroom; and we swap Covid stories, with him being delighted just to get a rest from aeons of coffee making, and me hanging out in Lake Tahoe in a half-price Airbnb atop a mountain. It's fun chat for this hour of the morning but we both have work to do.

### Vague Route

I'm heading out to see a mingin spidery lighthouse in Cobh today and, either before or after, I'll go for a tour of Blackrock Castle near Cork City. It used to be a lighthouse and is now an observatory. I still don't know my exact route but my main goal is to understand the watery complexity of Cork City and Cork Harbour which, by some reckonings, is the secord largest natural harbour in the world. I also have no clue how nice the surroundings of the city as I've only ever been to the centre, cricketing as a teenager, on the piss in my twenties, and getting my brain tested for my light sensitivity condition when I was thirty-odd. The city centre is an island on a split river which then explodes out into an enormous inland body of water, with islands and peninsulae and ports and boats.

**The city is adjacent to the Upper Harbour which is smaller than the Lower Harbour that stretches from C**

**I got a sense of the other side of the harbour, a** simple contiguous landmass, on my way to Roches Point Lighthouse. But here on the west side of the harbour, a lot more is going on, between the City of Cork, the Port of Cork, and the Cove of Cork, transliterated into Irish, post-independence, as *Cobh*. Then you've got Ringaskiddy and Crosshaven on their own little peninsulas in the south-west of the harbour, although I don't know if I'll get to them today.

And then there is the Upper Harbour, near the city, and the Lower Harbour between Cobh

### City views

I need to ditch the jammer, preferably for free. Your man can't think of a handy spot with free all-day parking but I ask a streetcleaner for suggestions and he racks his brains for a bit – you can actually see his head wobble as he thinks about it – and then suggests I head for Ballyvolane Shopping Centre, up the hill. There are a couple of council estates along the way where I'd be safe enough he reckons but I decide that outside Dunnes is the easiest, cos I once parked for the day outside someone's gaff in Ballyfermot and they double parked on top of me to learn me a lesson. It was great fun knocking on the door to ask them to move their car for me. So I drive up the steep hill out of town, knowing I'll regret it later when I'm knackered. **But once I'm on the bike – which is in flying form, in case you're asking; ~~I'll tell ya after, yeah?~~ – I'm delighted to be able to look out towards the whole of the city, if you discount the trees and buildings obscuring every view. I pass a street called Bellview Crescent and follow my nose, then a local's directions, to a viewing point down the back of a grassy lane which has retained the fancy French spelling (*BellevuePark*), whence you can stand on someone's wall and look out over the whole city.** But it's impossible to get a snap of its width, or appreciate the complexity of the interlocking waters. I can see the river on the near side by not the far side. All that stands out are sundry large buildings, mostly along the river, and a large expanse of low-rise buildings, with a chain of shallow hills in the background. I ask a postman where I can find a better view and, a little shocked by my disappointment, he recruits a local who suggests the Montenotte Hotel. It's a fancy modern hotel, the kind of place I imagine Paul Theroux, resting up after an evening of "romantic voyeurism"**,** drinking cocktails, getting a massage and maybe even a happy ending. But the views are blocked up by fluffy trees. All the same, I do love the way you can just snoop about a hotel's grounds for entertainment, and if push comes to shove, you can just order a coffee or a pint and hang out. One or two euro extra for a dose of mild opulence. Further up the steep river bank, the older Montenotte House has much better views of where the river spreads out into the large Lough Mahon to the East which is shiny blue in the morning sun.

### And they're off

![*The Cork North Quays. I genuinely don't know if this counts as a nice place as it is so unremarkably Irish and familiar-looking to me, **bar the mingin but possibly iconic car park whose demolition might set off huge protests.***](images/cork_north_quays_20240809_090010.jpg)

I descend back and follow the bike lane along the North Quays where I see the street cleaner is now yapping to the same cafe owner, the two of them being the early morning face of Cork City, and I wish modern cities had more public-facing professions like theirs. The bike lane leads to the Mardyke, a beautiful mix of green campuses along the river, and my favourite memories of Cork. I remember playing cricket there when I was like fifteen, with Blackie zipping it down and we had like four slips against their lower order, a real novelty for a wicketkeeper. But the best part was playing cards on the train down, and the camaraderie, a bunch of competitive kids fighting over everything. Flipper really was a mad yoke. I stop off in Fitzgerald Park, with its beautiful space-age hangout shelters, and I listen in as an ageing hashhead, in the most melodic of Cork City accents, dishes out nuggets of his philosophy to a young stoner, along with a few anecdotes from archive, including one about giving blowback to an autistic kid who ended up pissing his pants. As I write this, I realise we're exactly the same. I head over to admire the calm, manicured campus of UCC where ugly buildings hide behind gorgeous trees. Part of me laments not working in a university but I didn't have the stomach, after my PhD, to suffer through years of travel and uncertainty while also bringing up a young child.

-   FIt in SHandon Bells somehow

-   Like most things, I just couldn't bring myself to care enough about it. All the creativity was sucked out of your output and the job either attracted dull people or seemed to suck the life out of these who had any. You'd travel to conferences where everyone would spew out their thoughts but never want to collaborate.

But the real reason why I would have struggled to work in a university is that I have trouble with sustained reading. It goes by different names – Irlen syndrome, scotopic sensitivity, visual stress – but bright lights are a pain, and so are complex patterns. And reading is basically complex patterns on a bright background, so it tires me out and makes me irritable and gives me headaches and nausea, although only professional reading contexts would push me that far. I remember years ago I was editing a massive book about English spelling which me and the late Vivian Cook had envisioned, and I had a wad of essays to read, all printed out with possibly double spacing so I could lay into them with my red pen or maybe toxic marker. I was hanging out in Anna Hamilton's #BigHouse up in Enniskillen for the week. She was doing studying for her Masters in anthropology, so we had a nice skedj going, with long walks in the morning and a Samuel Beckett festival on in the evenings. So we'd read all day and then go watch Beckett being performed in some other language, with surtitles on the side. I have never had such headaches in my life and had to leave after every performance. The constant eye movement from stage to side-screen was just too much for my already tired brain. I felt awful for Anna who was hosting me for the week and had such a great set up for us.

Soon after, I heaerd about Irlen syndrome and I found a 'diagnostician' in Cork, so I went down with my wife, then early in our relationship. It turns out that she also has the condition, albeit less severely, and we both got specially tinted glasses. The idea is that sufferers are sensitive to specific frequencies of light, aka colours, so if you put those colours into a lens, and throw in whatever normal prescription you need on top, then the problem ought to go away.

For me, the lenses have been transformative, and my life is immeasurably better. The world looks stialnd I'm much less agitatedl

To you, today might be a cold, grey, November day but to me it is the most beautiful day of my life. I was recently diagnosed with a visual disorder called Irlen syndrome (thanks to advice from [Spiro Jamie](https://www.facebook.com/jamiespiro?__cft__[0]=AZXadDjDlJvrzWtruFJty9HkyuQf7lIlGP6kxqU_3f-9OWAfXmKoG6AG-AMHNUNqSkRpbml8w09oyZ0b8m6OqovjLgf5dYI_1D3J5wI73-gsV-fe9EhVzPs9FF1rbC2-4mggvW6mIPKaFOzIsYRRX_nl&__tn__=-]K-R)). I have just received these grey-blue corrective glasses that make me see the world normally. I cannot believe how nice it is.

Irlen is a visual disorder caused by an inability to process certain wavelengths, resulting in a syndrome of effects, including reading difficulties and hyper-sensitivity to bright lights. Its physical effects are legion - headaches, migraine, irritibility, tension, anxiety, loss of concentration and many, many more. Some sufferers are violent, including the actor Patrick Considine. Bono blatantly has it and Edgar Davids too. It is common among dyslexics and those with ADHD or Asperger's, but no one has any idea how many people suffer. I've had it all my life and I never knew. My job as an academic is the worst thing I could do. It is genetic (tick) and either caused or made worse by concussion (tickety tick). I have hardly ever sat still and even when I did, I couldn't stay still. At least not sober. It might be why I talk so much...

Now thoigh, I am astonished at how well arranged things are and I can't get over how quiet it all is, even in the city centre. Noise normally drives me to distraction. Normally buildings are like big torches beaming back blasts of light at lots of different angles. Now I can look at them as long as I like. I can see how they are shaped and detailed. Everything sits still like it does under moonlight or twilight. Letters stand on street signs and shopfronts, awaiting your attention, and now I can read for as long as I like. Sadly, I can finally see that Ireland is dimly lit in the winter.

I got the glasses yesterday. By the best coincidence ever, my dzeadly new girlfriend also has Irlen. We went down to Cork to pick up our glasses and she got hers first. She took me outside to see the world and she told me that it would be strange at first but then it gets nice. It was like the reverse of drunkenness. First I was bleary-eyed and then everything came into focus. Gently. Calmly. At its own pace. I felt relaxed at last and I still do.

**Irlen**

-   Shandon Bells house is a B&B outside the entrance to UCC and I stayed a night with my wife when we were first going out. It turns out we both have the same light sensitivity condition, often called Irlen syndrome, after Helen Irlen who tried to monopolise the treatment. I wear what look like shades, all the time, but the colour is actually a mix of dark blue, green and some weird

-   At the entrance to UCC is Shandon Bells House where my wife and I stayed one night back in 2014. We came down to get tested for a light sensitivity condition called Irlen Syntdrome...

-   where my wife once dropped her glasses into the river

I stall it through the city centre where people loiter near a glass cafe on the wide pavement and, with sunshine, I feellike I could be in Central Europe. I've no intention of watching people scampering around, looking to buy shoes or get to work, so I push on pronto and head out along the south quays, where the two sides of the river join back up and there is a sense of spaciousness again, with modern glass buildings scattered among the derelict warehouses. There is a nice feeling here of Rip it up and Start Again, where the city can be rebuilt, a less tragic version what happened to the cities bombed in World War II. I soon encounter the Marina Market.

**I'm starting to get a sense of what is going on and I finally have my route planned out. I'll follow the river to loop around the city centre and soak up the soothing green walkways around Mardyke and UCC, and then I can loop back into or around the city and out the docks towards Blackrock Castle. They do tours every hour and it'd ruin the day to have to rush back to catch one in the late afternoon. From there I'll head for Passage West to catch the ferry to Cobh and afterwards I'll either do a tour of that island and back via possibly Fota Island, or else I'll head out to Ringaskiddy and Crosshaven if the urge takes me.**

I've been to Cork City a handful of times in my life, cricketing as a teenager, drinking in my twenties, and a couple of later trips to get my eyes and brain tested for my light sensitivity condition, but I always seem to be crossing bridges and getting lost. I've never spent a chunk of time here.

**Blackrock Castle**

![[Blackrock Castle](https://www.buildingsofireland.ie/buildings-search/building/20864028/blackrock-castle-castle-road-mahon-blackrock-cork). "*Detached castellated fortification, re-constructed 1829, having circular five-storey crenellated tower to the north-west on to the Lee River with two crenellated towers to south set in courtyard bounded by curtain wall with single- and two-storey buildings*."](images/blackrock_from_road_20240809_102643.jpg)

The widened river continues out to Blackrock Castle and alongside it is the large, partially developed Marina Park screaming watch this space, as it's only been open since 2022, and is ripe for new subsections. The area is dominated by Pairc Ui Chaoimh where Cork play GAA and Munster have started playing a few rugby matches, instead of the oversized Thomond Park in their undersized base town of Limerick. There's space aplenty to cycle through until I come out onto Blackrock Road and into a mature suburb. Blackrock Castle sits near the corner of the rectangular peninsula, think Turkey flipped in the mirror, with the river on top opening out to the much larger Lough Mahon to the east. It's on the tiniest of peninulas, with views across the Lough, making it an ideal spot for a lookout tower and as a lighthouse guiding ships from the lough into the river.

It's half ten now so I get a ticket for the tour at eleven, leave my phone to charge in the ticket office and stall over for a coffee in what turns out to be a restaurant in love with itself. The lady outside tells me I can't wear my cycling shoes inside, which is fairenuffski, so I tell her I'll just take them off. Now she has to go and ask the hashtag General Manager if he can allow me in, so I stand outside and seethe a while until she comes back, all smiles, and welcomes me in. Without asking my opinion, she sits me down on a godawful middle-of-the-room seat, like an island on a lake, and then hands me a well-laid out menu. But I've just nailed a mango and a half block of cheese, so I only order a scone and a Yorkshire Toffee, then blast out a ton of notes, while Hozier mimics do their best to put me off. I'm a smidge late for the tour but it turns out to be a disappointment as the guide, a Swedish postgrad at a guess, has run out of passion for the task and blasts through her spiel, then doesn't even open the floor for questions. It's like we paid in just to get access to the view from the top. Plus a chance to see a framed picture on the wall of a Cork flag in space. It turns out that everyone – in person, in print, on video and across the Jimi Internet – has the same spiel about the castle's remarkable range of uses dating back to 1582. It has been a signalling station. A lighthouse. A defence fortification. A gun battery. A maritime court. A place for banquets. A restaurant. A rowing club. A burnt out wreck. A ruin. A brick shithouse. And now, in the most unlikely of outcomes, an observatory. Somehow, just a few clicks from a city centre, it is dark enough for astronomers to gaze at the stars and photocopy the white-on-black sky. Downstairs, a video shows a passionate researcher explaining her work and how the telescopes are used. My interest is whetted enough to check out [their YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@bcoeducation/videos) about the Universe or come back again by gatecrashing a more informative school tour which seems to be their real focus. No one seems to know anything about the lighthouse which has been inactive since 1903, although [Lighthouse Pete notes](https://irishlighthouses.blogspot.com/2014/05/blackrock-castle-cork.html) that it was one of a series of such lights guiding ships in and out of the river. But it doesn't appear to have had a Fresnel Lens or any of the trimmings. I'm just glad I got to see such a beautiful and unusual building, especially given how unromantic the next lighthouse is.

### The Cove of Cork

![*Modern Cobh has an ever-changing population of micro-immigrants who arrive on giant boats and look to trade cash for bottled culture.*](images/IMG_20240809_153038.jpg)

The next phase of the trip involves a small bit of actual cycling. A greenway follows the coast all the way to Passage West where the ferry zips back and forth to Great Island, home to Cobh. It's good to be moving but then I have to stall on again as I've just missed the ferry. The views across the passage are fantastic and I spot a row of multi-coloured houses on high which I'll have to add to me latest collection: Council Houses with a view. As I get off the ferry, some Yanks ask me where the *Titanic Experience* is. I didn't know there was one and I must say it's not an experience I myself would not like to have, although it sounds like Cobh is still cashing in on the prestige of being the doomed ship's last port of call. I see a bunch of scaldy-ass industrial stuff sticking up to our right slash south, and I tell them it has to be that way. I follow my own guesswork directions and slowly overtake a family of four cyclists, acting out my dream holiday, albeit laden down with camping gear. For some reason, they are making no effort to use each other's draft and ease the burden, a reminder that families are mostly brutal at teamwork.

Round the corner, in the actual water, and big enough to block my view of the second possibly largest harbour in the world, sits a floating city, sidegridded with a thousand or more mini balconies, a handful of lifeboats, and a bunch of boat stuff on the roof. It's a real-life Cruise Ship, which I've never seen this close up, and it looks like some kids got a squillion copies of the same Lego set and morphed it into a monster boat.

![Cobh](images/cobh_church_20240809_132700.jpg)

From my vantage point, I can see a procession of badly-oiled machines plod off the ship and march up to the town. Everything in Cobh converges at one junction, a vortex of slowmoving humans and vehicles flowing in from all sides. There is a depression in the cliffs, with the main street on the central passage coming from the north; a descent along the coast from both west and east, and up from the port to the south. I descend thither to find that the locals have seen the tourists coming, and there's a glut of boozers, restaurants and tat floggers sucking lifeblood cash from these proverbial fish out of actual water. While the tourists vary greatly by tongue and complexion, they are united by their gawking faces and the tiny gift bags they clutch. Light reflects evenly off their designer clothes which haven't been, and may never go, through fifty-plus cycles in the Rogan Josh. I'm looking forward to asking them about their experiences, cooped up on that monster ship, but first I have to head East out of town to get closer to the lighthouse.

![asdf](images/spitbank_cork_harbour_20240809_133248.jpg)

I head out of the town up the steep East Hill where there is a marginally better viewing point of the lighthouse, over 700m out at sea. There is little visible beauty in the two-tier structure, with its skinny, arachnid legs crouching in the sea and a dumpy lightbulb atop its raised, octagonal floor. The beauty is in the security of the corkscrew design, designed by, astonishingly, a blind engineer from Belfast called Alexander Mitchell, whose *screw pile* design was used in 150 North American lighthouses and several more in Britain and Ireland, including the one I forgot about in Dundalk Bay, and one in Moville, Co Donegal which I am yet to see. Those two have space enough for a lighthouse keeper but the one here in Cobh does not, so the keeper would nip back and forth on the relatively calm waters of the harbour. [^ttl_20_blackrock_castle_cobh-1]

[^ttl_20_blackrock_castle_cobh-1]: <https://www.buildingsofireland.ie/building-of-the-month/spitbank-lighthouse-cork-harbour-county-cork/>

The expanse of Cork's lower harbour, shaped like a conical flask, is perfectly visible from this vantage point, and there are many locals who wake up daily to this extraordinary view, although it must seldom be this clear and calm. In the distance is a relatively narrow strait out to the ocean, with Roche's Point lighthouse marking the eastmost point (left). The eastern landmass is simpler and contiguous, and the Aghada power station sits at the centre, with its red & white hooped tower looking particularly well at this distance. The 'base of the flask' is the southern edge of rectangular Great Island, along which Cobh sits. The view of the west side (right) is dominated by two nearby islands, Haulbowline and Spike, both with curious histories, and these obscure the more complex peninsulas behind them. Ringaskiddy, where Cork's passenger ferries dock, and Crosshaven on the strait which I'd like to see today but probably won't have time. Haulbowline used to have a steel plant and so much toxic waste was dumped off the side of the island that it has grown from sixty to eighty acres in size. That space is now a young park, but some have blamed it for Cobh having the highest rates of cancer in Ireland.[^ttl_20_blackrock_castle_cobh-2] **Spike Island has been both a prison and military base and remained under British control after partition, as part of the the so-called Treaty Ports**, until it was returned in 1938, along with Berehaven, in Bantry Bay, and Lough Swilly in Donegal. It is now a tourist attraction with boats shuttling over from the centre of Cobh.

[^ttl_20_blackrock_castle_cobh-2]: <https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/town-in-shadow-of-toxic-dump-has-40pc-higher-cancer-rate/26803481.html>

I do a quick loop around the rest of the town, which on the periphery looks like every other town in Ireland, albeit not so sprawling, and I then descend back down t St Colman's Church, aka Cobh Cathedral, to which the cruise ship tourists have ascended. In a little park across the road, a gang of uninterested harpists pluck notes for the polite, uninspired tourists who really need to be sent on a few laps of the town to get the blood moving. I'm reminded of my days as a tour guide in the Vatican, herding them about and pointing to outstanding acts of beauty. The cathedral, in it high narrowness, reminds me of John's Lane Church on Thomas St, and I sit down to chillax and write my notes, but I realise how thirsty I am, and how much of a thirst I have on me, so I roll back down the hill and, back in the vortical town centre, I nip in to Kelly's pub for a Brit Award and a break from the sun.

### Sean O'Neill from Cardigan

I might as a well be in Temple Bar, although the tourists are here for such a short time that they don't even know they are supposed to be drinking Guinness. Down the back is a posse of Ozzies with stompingly strong accents and I listen in while taking a video of a map on the wall. It shows the south-west of Ireland's coast with all of the lighthouses flashing in what I assume is their distinctive pattern. On another wall is a map of Cork Harbour and its flashing lights. I set up camp back at the bar, with a fresh Moretti and a Dalston Dinner. That's a bag of salted peanuts tossed over a bag a salt'n'vinegar crisps, beloved of the husband of Niki Segnit, the great (food) writer. I scribble away like an angsty teen, except I'm giggling and gesticulating away as I work out my words. Somehow, I don't get talking to any of the cruise ship people. My first vickies are the cyclists I passed out on my way here. They're not up for much chat, in English or French, but it turns out they've cycled from Rosslare and they kipped in Clonvilla campsite last night where they had their first shower in four days. I just hope they didn't follow the N25 all the way here.

Eventually, a sunbattered, workmuscled young man sits down and orders a pint and a whiskey chaser, and he turns out to be a real-life fisherman, fresh from his day on the water. He's as gabby as they come and delighted to tell me every detail of his life, unlike the solitudinous types who are really fishing for silence. I can't quite place his Southern British accent but I'm not going to interrupt his #flow. He goes out at 3am every morning and is finished by lunchtime, delighted to have the day to himself after. They leave bait and boxes in certain locations and it's a constant puzzle to work out where the fish are. It's a science, really. It's just him and the boat and its owner, and he's chuffed to have finally found someone he gets on with as he's his own man, and he's been worked to the bone. He shows me the hack of his hands and tells me of the brutality some employers have put him through. He's been in Cobh for nearly a year and wants to stay. He's worked all over England mostly but he's from Cardigan in Wales, which is much like Ireland, and he's proud of himself for getting out, unlike everyone he grew up with. He's wanted to be a fisherman since he was a teenager and he just went and did it, and I'm both delighted for him and inspired because all I want to be is a writer and I need to focus on that. I won't be getting another life. He shows me some snaps he's taken from the boat and he wants to start flogging prints to the tourists. The sky. The sun. The water. The cruise ships. Printing them on canvas is the way to go, he reckons, cos the cruise ship tourists have their luggage weighed. I'm curious to know the cost of production too as I'm thinking of doing something with my own photos, although I'm worried the quality won't scale up. But to begin, I could print off photos of Wicklow for the wall in my guest room. I ask if I should head out to Crosshaven next or do a lap of the island and he tells me to do the latter. He did it in his sea kayak recently and says it'll look great in the sunshine. A couple of lads in the sunshine outside tell me to do the same.

### Lap of Great Island

![*East Ferry Marina is a gem among the inland waters that surround Great Island, and, judging by the warning signs, a good spot for some cheeky drug smuggling.*](images/east_ferry_20240809_161344.jpg)

The inland waters that surround Great Island turn out to be a let down after the spectacular views across Lower Cork Harbour. It's a 20k loop around the island and the best spot I find is East Ferry Marina, which may or may not be known as the Marlogue. The entrance to the jetty is blocked by an ugly gridded gate and I get a Brendan Butchers from a smug couple heading out to their boat who are highly suspicious of my unexpected presence. A notice from the Customs Drugs Watch makes an appeal to anyone who has 'seen or heard anything suspicious' and I'm half wondering if I should get ahead of the narrative and report the smarmy pair before they report me as a potential bike courier.

![*If anything is suspicious round here, it's my presence on a bicycle.*](images/drugs_watch_20240809_161203.jpg)

I head back along the quiet northern edge of the island where the tide is now out, increasing my disappointment, and eventually I come across [a low humpback bridge](https://www.buildingsofireland.ie/buildings-search/building/20907578/belvelly-bridge-belvelly-cork) at the narrow point between Great Island and Fota Island. Standing proudly nearby is [Belvelly Castle](https://www.irishexaminer.com/property/arid-30916854.html), an old watchtower which has been beautifully restored by an Antrim developer called Garry Wilson who one day wants to restore a lighthouse. My brain is too full now to be checking out the recreation-heavy Fota Island, with its zoo and resort and golf course, so I peg it back to the ferry port where the driver, if that's what they're even called, stalls the ball for me, and minutes later I'm back in Passage. The #greenway into Cork City is a lot busier at this hour, mostly with commuters coming against me, and it's a bit shorter on the diagonal with Blackrock Castle cut out. This is quality urban green space and I look forward to seeing its growth in the future.

### Marina Market

I rock up to the Marina Market where the food choices are legion, and I lounge on a couch with a curry while wedged between two different dining groups. The family to my right have made the mistake of ordering from like five different places so the dad is up and down and everyone's food comes at different times. It's the sort of detail that people will need to learn about as more of these public eateries emerge. The teenage girls on my left are just lounging, maximising the use of their bubble tea. It's just great to see a proper public space for people, with both a roof and fresh air. The place emerged during Covid as a semi-openair #safespace for a few vendors to flog scran and coffee, and it has grown and formalized since, albeit with wooden everything. Despite battles over its legitimacy, much of it to do with the presence of a chemical plant next door, the council granted it five more years of trading, starting in late 2023, and long may it last. It's a great example of bottom-up development and a welcome reprieve from the sterile dross that populates the stupidly expensive mixed-use developments, where the price of trade is too high for all but the most established chain stores, meaning that the next-generation living they promote has more in common with an airport than a close-knit community. I can't emphasize enough how important it is to have affordable eateries in our society, with space for punters to hashtag chill and mingle. Clearly they need to be rooved in Ireland, with our famous fresh air blowing through, and the Marina Market is doing all of this. It'd just be nice if they could move on from the permasesh music and maybe branch out to some, like, *early* Fleetwood Mac?

"will create a vibrant, dynamic mixed-use neighbourhood for Cork with the potential to transform the South Docks into a major driver of economic activity and employment and a cultural and tourist landmark for years to come."

**It's 5k back to the car via the tail end of rush hour but my legs are still warm enough to piss up the hill and give out to a bus driver who could do with some patience training from Dublin Bus. I'm in the car before 7 to watch Rhasidat Adeleke coming fourth in the Olympic 400m, and it reminds me of a young Sonia being passed out on the inside in Barcelona. RTE do their level best to look for positives, even interviewing her a second time**

**It was lovely last night to do a visual recap of so many places I've been to along the southern coast. Waterford. Dungarvan. Youghal. Each trip is so vivid in my memory, between actually being there and then the long, slow, grinding mastication of that memory into readable words. The process also deletes some details and the drive has reconnected some dots. The sun was setting slowly in front of me along the N25 and a crescent moon popped up beside it. I have a sense of finality too, and symmetry, finishing up this book in Cork, the wetter, mellower little sibling city to Dublin where it all began.**

Cobh is a harbour with a town attached

-   I get off the ferry, turn right, and pass out a family of camper cyclists, #welljeal, which is my dream holiday.

-   Suddenly Cobh appears on my right, in the actual awter, a floating town, sidegridded with a thousand mini balconies, a handful of lifeboats, and a bunch of weird boat stuff on the roof.

-   I descend down the hill and find a permatown attached to the cruise ship, and a glut of boozers, restaurans and tat floggers sucking lifeblood cash from these proverbial fish out of actual water.

-   Across the water, is the Soviet Republic of East Cork, with Whitegate Power Station looking particularly well from this distance with its single red&white hooped tower. Further out is Roches Point and a narrow channel through which giant boats ease through, including the Titanic on its last stop.

Cork City is a complex place and I've never understood it very well, with all its bridges and looparooneys and impossibly steep streets on one side, so I've decided to follow the water and try to understand its topography that way. I'm parked on the smaller North side of the city, not far from the train station

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cork_(city)>

Wikipedia summarises the geography better than I can:

*The city centre is an island between two channels of the [River Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Lee_(Ireland) "River Lee (Ireland)") which meet downstream at its eastern end, where the [quays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quay "Quay") and [docks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dock_(maritime) "Dock (maritime)") along the river lead outwards towards [Lough Mahon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lough_Mahon "Lough Mahon") and [Cork Harbour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cork_Harbour "Cork Harbour"), one of the largest natural harbours in the world."*

-   When I lived off Meath St, as a lonely postgrad, I'd pop in to Mick in the veg shop or
-   The bike lane brings me out towards the Mardyke, although I nearly get doored by a driver getting out of his car but I swerve in time. I don't blame him for not looking, I blame whoever designs and permits a column of parked cars between a road and a bike lane, because motorists understandably let their guard down on the non-road side. After the skinny metal bridge the bike lane follows the river

*Peat fires were lit atop the castle to guide ships at least since 1608, when James I transferred the tower to local control. By the nineteenth century lights were displayed through a window of the taller tower, which came to be known as the Lighthouse Tower.*
