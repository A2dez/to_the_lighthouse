title: "Blackrock Castle"

Last night's drive to Cork let me do visual recap of so many places I've been to along the southern coast in the last year, with the sun setting slowly in front of me along the N25 and a crescent moon popping up to play beside it. Each day out is so recollectable, between the memories of being there and then the long, slow, grinding mastication of that memory into readable words. But seeing it allows the memories to fit back into the geography. It feels right to finish up this book in Cork, Dublin's wetter, mellower little sibling city.

I got in at like half ten last night, parked up outside St Patrick's Church, and then kipped in a dorm room in Sheila's Hostel. As soon as I got to the hostel I was to text my wife – which I did, tobefairtome – to let her know that the place wasn't a basically homeless shelter, cos you wouldn't know these days. **But it turns out nothing has changed in hostels, bar me, after an absence of eleven scarlifying years.**

CONNECT UP

**I was half nervous to be in a hostel at my age but I remember from my galavanting pisshead youth** days that there were always a few oddball cyclists kipping in hostels, sober and boring, in need of a cheap mattress and an early exit. I'm actually surprised to see how many people my age or older are floating about, between muinteoir types leading teenage groups, and just a few, letsbehonesthere, weirdos. In my room, everyone's asleep at half eleven when I climb up the creaking ladder into my top bunk, out of which is growing a ledge with a USB port. I

*I reflect with delight that is the only notable difference since the last time I was in one of these places, back in 2013.*

*FIX UP THIS IDEA\@S WORDING*

*It's been that long since I kipped in a Youth Hostel, as they are probably no longer known, that I have **completed the categorical transition** from being your typical galavanting pissheid tourist to being your typical sober, galavanting cyclist in need of a stingy mattress.*

*Absolutely nothing has changed in the intervening eleven years except that the top bunks now have USB ports growing out of them, and I think to myself, wouldn't it be so soothing if we could maintain this glacial level of technological progress over the remaining few decades of my life, and spend our energy fixing the existing problems in the world.*

I wake up at half three having a nightmare about being squashed among dozens of people in a maybe gas chamber, so I get out of the Margaret, hit the Soviet, and notice that another room's door is being wedged open with a bin. I do the same for my room and kip away til half six when the loudest person i the world wakes me up. I get the flock out of there and I'm drinking coffee in Bus Stop Coffee by 7am.

then wedge the door open with a bin to let some air in. I'm awake at half six

Cork City is a complex place and I've never understood it very well, with all its bridges and looparooneys and impossibly steep streets on one side, so I've decided to follow the water and try to understand its topography that way.

**CAFE CHAT**

Your man in the cafe isn't specific enough about where to park but a street cleaner racks his brains for a bit - you can actually see his head actually wobble as he thinks about it - and then suggests I head for Ballyvolane Shopping Centre, up the hill. There are a couple of council estates along the way in which I'd be safe enough he reckons but I decide that outside Dunnes is the easiest, especially with my Dublin reg. So I drive up the hill, knowing I'll regret it later when I'm knackered, and once I whip out my Falcon and head townwards I can see all over Cork City, if you discount the trees and buildings obscuring my view. I spot a place called Bellview and sure enough there's a great viewing point over the whole city, although it's impossible to get a snap of its width. The city is long and skinny, the kind of shape you might expect from a river island. I ask a postman where I can get a better view and then he recruits a local who sends me for Montenotte Hotel. It's a fancy modern hotel, the kind of place I imagine Paul Theroux, resting up after an evening of voyeurism **CHECK FULL PHRASE,** getting a massage and drinking cocktails. But the views are riddled with trees. All the same, I do love the way you can just snoop about a hotel's grounds for entertainment, and if push comes to shove, you can just order a coffee or a pint and hang out. Back up the cliff, the older Montenotte House has better view of where the river starts spreading out and becomes a great wide harbour. ADD MORE

I'm starting to get a sense of what is going on, so I descend back down to the town and see the streetsweeper now out yapping to the barista. The two lads being the public face of the city.

It's an island on a river which explodes out into an enormous inland body of water, with islands and headlands and ports and boats and watery stuff. On my way to Roshes Point, I got a sense of the East side of the harbour, a simple contiguous landmass, but the complexity lies on the west side, which includes the City of Cork, the Port of Cork and the Cove of Cork, transliterated into Irish, post-independence, as *Cobh*. And plenty more as I'd find out.

I got a sense of the East side of the harbour from Whitegate and Roches Point but I've no idea what's going on the west side, between the City and Cobh - the Cove of Cork - where the last of the mild non-Atlantic lighthouses awaits me, on stilts somewhere in the water. There's also the delicate little Blackrock Castle which used to function as a lighthouse so I can check that out too whil e I'm #atit.

I've been here a handful of times in my life, cricketing as a teenager, drinking in my twenties, and a couple of later trips to get my eyes and brain tested for light sensitivity, but I always seem to be crossing bridges
