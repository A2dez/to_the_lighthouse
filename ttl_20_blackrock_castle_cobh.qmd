I got in to Cork City at like half ten last night, parked up outside St Patrick's Church, and then kipped in a dorm room in Sheila's Hostel, a well-run spot. As soon as I got to the hostel I was to text my wife – which I did, tobefairtome – to confirm that the place wasn't a basically homeless shelter, cos you wouldn't know these days. I was half embarrassed to be in a hostel at my age but I remember from my galavanting pisshead youth that there were always a few oddball cyclists kipping in hostels, sober and old, in need of a cheap mattress and an early exit. I'm actually surprised to see how many people my age or older are floating about, between muinteoir types leading teenage groups, and just a few, ifwe'rehonest, weirdos. Nothing else has changed in the eleven years since I was last in one of these places. Giddy reception staff. Tiny unisex bathrooms. People planning out their trips of an evening. An emotional guitarist. Luckily there's no bar. In my room, everyone's asleep when I climb up the creaking ladder into my top bunk. The bed has a ledge welded onto it with a USB port and I reflect with delight that is the only notable difference since the last time I was in one of these places, back in like 2013. Wouldn't it be so soothing if we could chillax and maintain this glacial level of technological progress over the remaining few decades of my life. I wake up at half three having a nightmare about being squashed among dozens of people in a maybe gas chamber. The dorm room turns out to be windowless and thus airless. I get out of the Margaret, hit the Soviet, and notice that another room's door is being wedged open with a bin. So I do the same for mine and kip away til half six when the loudest person in the world wakes me up, rolling a needlessly cigarette in the dark, on his bed, like a prisoner.

### Vague Route

I'm heading out to see a mingin spidery lighthouse in Cobh today and, either before or after, I'll go for a tour of Blackrock Castle near Cork City. It used to be a lighthouse and is now an observatory. I still don't know my exact route but my main goal is to understand the watery complexity of Cork harbour which, by some

The city centre is an island on a river **and there's no end of bridges.** The river explodes out into an enormous inland body of water, with islands and peninsulae and ports and boats. I got a sense of the other side of the harbour, a simple contiguous landmass, on my way to Roches Point Lighthouse. But here on the west side of the harbour, a lot more is going on, between the City of Cork, the Port of Cork, and the Cove of Cork, transliterated into Irish, post-independence, as *Cobh*. Then you've got Ringaskiddy and Crosshaven on their own little peninsulas in the south-west of the harbour, although I don't know if I'll get to them today.

**POSSIBLY MOVE OR DROP THIS**

*It was lovely last night to do a visual recap of so many places I've been to along the southern coast. Waterford. Dungarvan. Youghal. Each trip is so vivid in my memory, between actually being there and then the long, slow, grinding mastication of that memory into readable words. The process also deletes some details and the drive has reconnected some dots. The sun was setting slowly in front of me along the N25 and a crescent moon popped up beside it. I have a sense of finality too, and symmetry, finishing up this book in Cork, the wetter, mellower little sibling city to Dublin where it all began.*

### City views

Cork City is empty at 7am, but Bus Stop Coffee on Patrick's Quay is open and the owner is well up for the yaps. He's telling me all about the Pakistani fella who won the javelin there last night, one of just six athletes from that country. My favourite story is of the Afghan sisters who fled their country before the Taliban came back in to power and now the cyclists are in the Olympic Road Race, and both even made an early breakaway. We reminisce about watching the Barcelona Olympics as kids, him with tonsillitis and the family's black-and-white telly in his bedroom; and we swap Covid stories, with him being delighted just to get a rest from aeons of coffee making, and me hanging out in Lake Tahoe in a half-price Airbnb atop a mountain. It's quality chat for this hour of the morning but I have work to do.

I need to ditch the jammer, preferably for free. Your man can't think of a handy spot with free all-day parking but I ask a streetcleaner for suggestions and he racks his brains for a bit - you can actually see his head wobble as he thinks about it - and then suggests I head for Ballyvolane Shopping Centre, up the hill. There are a couple of council estates along the way where I'd be safe enough he reckons but I decide that outside Dunnes is the easiest, cos I once parked for the day outside someone's gaff in Ballyfermot and they double parked on top of me to learn me a lesson. It was great fun knocking on the door to ask them to mover their car for me. So I drive up the steep hill out of town, knowing I'll regret it later when I'm knackered. **But once I'm on the bike – which is in flying form, in case you're asking; ~~I'll tell ya after, yeah?~~ – I'm delighted to be able to look out towards the whole of the city, if you discount the trees and buildings obscuring every view. I pass a street called Bellview Crescent and follow my nose, then a local's directions, to a viewing point down the back of a grassy lane which has retained the fancy French spelling (*BellevuePark*), whence you can stand on someone's wall and look out over the whole city.** But it's impossible to get a snap of its width, or appreciate the complexity of the interlocking waters. I can see the river on the near side by not the far side. All that stands out are sundry large buildings, mostly along the river, and a large expanse of low-rise buildings, with a chain of shallow hills in the background. I ask a postman where I can find a better view and, a little shocked by my disappointment, he recruits a local who suggests the Montenotte Hotel. It's a fancy modern hotel, the kind of place I imagine Paul Theroux, resting up after an evening of "romantic voyeurism"**,** drinking cocktails, getting a massage and maybe even a happy ending. But the views are blocked up by fluffy trees. All the same, I do love the way you can just snoop about a hotel's grounds for entertainment, and if push comes to shove, you can just order a coffee or a pint and hang out. One or two euro extra for a dose of mild opulence. Further up the steep river bank, the older Montenotte House has much better views of where the river spreads out into the large Lough Mahon to the East which is shiny blue in the morning sun.

### And they're off

![*The Cork North Quays. I genuinely don't know if this counts as a nice place as it is so unremarkably Irish and familiar-looking to me, **bar the mingin but possibly iconic car park whose demolition might set off huge protests.*** ](images/cork_north_quays_20240809_090010.jpg)

I descend back and follow the bike lane along the North Quays where I see the street cleaner is now yapping to the same cafe owner, the two of them being the early morning face of Cork City. **Cities would be so much more fun if there were more professions that allowed**

The bike lane brings me out towards the Mardyke, although I nearly get doored by a driver getting out of his car but I swerve in time. I don't blame him for not looking, I blame whoever designs and permits a column of parked cars between a road and a bike lane, because motorists understandably let their guard down on the non-road side. After the skinny metal bridge the bike lane follows the river

**I'm starting to get a sense of what is going on and I finally have my route planned out. I'll follow the river to loop around the city centre and soak up the soothing green walkways around Mardyke and UCC, and then I can loop back into or around the city and out the docks towards Blackrock Castle. They do tours every hour and it'd ruin the day to have to rush back to catch one in the late afternoon. From there I'll head for Passage West to catch the ferry to Cobh and afterwards I'll either do a tour of that island and back via possibly Fota Island, or else I'll head out to Ringaskiddy and Crosshaven if the urge takes me.**

I've been to Cork City a handful of times in my life, cricketing as a teenager, drinking in my twenties, and a couple of later trips to get my eyes and brain tested for my light sensitivity condition, but I always seem to be crossing bridges and getting lost. I've never spent a chunk of time here.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Work

-   It's odd to look at people going to work and I'm thinking, I *never* want to do that again, even in a unimehversity?

Mardyke

-   So I stall it out to the Mardyke to get the shape of the city adnd a trip down memory lane

UCC

-   beautifully manicured campus, buildings well hidden behind the trees and sequoias, reminds me of Scoil Oilibheir, instead of the functional squish of Valentine's new school.

-   loop around campus and back to the city

City

-   warm day, could be central europe, croatians sitting out having their coffee, sun shining

-   People scrambling to buy shoes, no interest in hanging round

-

-   Port of Cork

-   Marina Market, hundy pee coming here later for my dinner

-   Set up during covid and developed from there, bizarre setting, refused permission

-   a chunk of city which is being repurposed. Large derelict buildings and emergent facilities e.g. Marina Market

-   Rip it up and start again space. Always good to get some breathing space in this country cos verything is so old and cramped

-   spacious, semi-developed park which houses Pairc Ui Chaoimh

    -   astonishing that Munster Rugby plays Limerick when they could be here with a larger population and much better attendances

-   A Turkey-shaped appendix peninsula with limited access

waiting for ferry

-   Idle engine wanker, so go and sit on a lovely warm sunny bench nearer the road and soak up the view while it's wooden heat seeps into me.

-   more cyclists come and stand waiting while yer wan's fumes keep pumping out, so I finally ask her to turn it off and she does but she gives me a Brendan Butchers. But now I'm raging cos I've given up my lovely bench as I can't exactly ask her to turn off her engine then bounce myself.

-   Ferry is E3 rtn. There's no ferry from Cobh to Ringaskiddy so I'll have to do the dreaded doublebackarooney. Eejit gives me a single

### The Cove of Cork

![*On land, Cobh looks like a normal Irish place but cruise ships dock there and flood the town with a vampiric need for retail therapy.*](images/cobh_cruise_ship_20240809_153054.jpg)

As I get off the ferry, some Yanks ask me where the *Titanic Experience* is. I didn't know there was one and I must say it's not an experience I myself would like to have. I see a bunch of scaldy-ass industrial stuff sticking up to our right slash south, and I tell them it has to be that way, but I'm also wondering if that's got anything to do with Cobh being the cancer capital of Ireland.[^ttl_20_blackrock_castle_cobh-1] I follow my own guesswork directions and slowly overtake a family of four cyclists, acting out my dream holiday, albeit laden down with camping gear. For some reason, they are making no effort to use each other's draft and ease the burden.

[^ttl_20_blackrock_castle_cobh-1]: <https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/town-in-shadow-of-toxic-dump-has-40pc-higher-cancer-rate/26803481.html>

Suddenly, one half of Cobh appears on my right, in the actual water, a floating city, sidegridded with a thousand or more mini balconies, a handful of lifeboats, and a bunch of boat stuff on the roof. It's a real-life Cruise Ship, which I've never seen this close up, and it looks like some kids got multiple copies of the same Lego set and morphed it into a monster boat. From my vantage point, I can see a procession of badly-oiled machines plod off the ship and march up to the town.

![*The Cove of Cork, nowadays spelt Cobh, is a pretty little town wedged between the tallest church in Ireland and a cruise ship.*](images/cobh_church_20240809_132700.jpg){alt="Cobh"}

Everything in Cobh converges at one junction, a vortex of slowmoving humans and vehicles flowing in from all sides. There is a depression in the cliffs, with the main street on the central passage coming from the north; a descent along the coast from both west and east, and up from the port to the south. I descend thither to find that the locals have seen the tourists coming, and there's a glut of boozers, restaurants and tat floggers sucking lifeblood cash from these proverbial fish out of actual water. While these tourists vary greatly by tongue and complexion, they are united by their gawking faces and the way light reflects evenly off their designer clothes which haven't been, and may never go, through fifty-plus cycles in the Rogan Josh. I'm looking forward to asking them about their experiences, cooped up on that monster ship, but first I have to head East out of town to get closer to the lighthouse.

![asdf](images/spitbank_cork_harbour_20240809_133248.jpg)

I head out of the town up the steep East Hill where there is a slightly better viewing point of the lighthouse, over 700m out at sea. There is no visible beauty in the two-tier structure, with its skinny, arachnid legs crouching in the sea and a dumpy lightbulb atop its raised, octagonal floor. The beauty is in the security of the corkscrew design, designed by, astonishingly, a blind engineer from Belfast called Alexander Mitchell, whose *screw pile* design was used in 150 North American lighthouses and several more in Britain and Ireland, including the one I forgot about in Dundalk, and one in Moville, Co Donegal which I am yet to see. Those two have space enough for a lighthouse keeper but the one here in Cobh does not, so the keeper would nip back and forth on the relatively calm waters of the harbour.

Across the water, is the Soviet Republic of East Cork, with Whitegate Power Station looking particularly well from this distance with its single red&white hooped tower. Further out is Roches Point and a narrowchannel through which giant boats ease through, including the Titanic on its last stop.

Cork City is a complex place and I've never understood it very well, with all its bridges and looparooneys and impossibly steep streets on one side, so I've decided to follow the water and try to understand its topography that way. I'm parked on the smaller North side of the city, not far from the train station

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cork_(city)>

Wikipedia summarises the geography better than I can:

*The city centre is an island between two channels of the [River Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Lee_(Ireland) "River Lee (Ireland)") which meet downstream at its eastern end, where the [quays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quay "Quay") and [docks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dock_(maritime) "Dock (maritime)") along the river lead outwards towards [Lough Mahon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lough_Mahon "Lough Mahon") and [Cork Harbour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cork_Harbour "Cork Harbour"), one of the largest natural harbours in the world."*
