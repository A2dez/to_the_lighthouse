## **Roche's Point**

I could have just gone early while it was sunny but I buzzed about the campsite with the family and now it's pissing rain. We're talking yellow weather warning across the entire south-eastern counties, and East Cork would be included if it was its own county, which it nearly could be. So I load up the family, cos there's no point in them staying in the campsite in this weather, put the bike on the back of the car and drive to Ballycotton to start afresh. I'm hoping I might be able to head

I stall it back for a pint in the old St Colman's Church, built in the 1830s by the Church of Ireland community which has since dwindled away, and now the building has been repurposed as a music venue called Sea Church and a restaurant. I sit in the waiting area where I can dodge the stodgy restaurant vibes and write my notes while watching the bar staff interact. It's only 20k or so Roche's Point lighthouse now so I could push on there now or else head back to the beach with the family and finish off the cycling tomorrow.

sit down for a pint and write up my notes before stalling it back to Garryvoe to join up with the family. Realistically, I could have just pushed on to Roche's Point, 24k from here, and my wife would have collected me from there, as planned, but I end up caught between two stools. By

but guilt got the better of me, and now I have another lighthouse hanging over me.

I could have gone early in the morning, enjoyed the bright morning and been home by midday but I hung around the campsite with the family and now I need to get this other lighthouse ticked off in the pissings of rain. So we all drive to Ballycotton harbour after lunch and I take my bike off the bike rack this time and

Ballycotton Cliff walk is for pedestrians only and in this wind it is to be avoided too so I end up having to double back out of the town

I eventually come to the crossroads village of Cloyne where I find a round tower dating from the tenth possibly Century. Round the corner a stone mason is getting ready to rebuild the wall around the old Cathedral although sadly he's not interested in explaining the minutiae of the job. The most famous Bishop of Cloyne was [George Berkeley](https://www.dib.ie/index.php/biography/berkeley-george-a0611) (1685-1753) whose philosophy is still read today by undergrads, including my own mates in Trinnerz who would bang on about his theories of vision on The Ramp and in Grogans. It might seem odd nowadays that a university professor would also be member of the clergy but it was then mandatory, on taking up a fellowship, to take Holy Orders and abstain from marriage. After writing his best known works, Berkeley hit the road, first to Italy and later to Bermuda and the American Colonies where he tried to establish a university and, regrettably, kept some slaves. Years later, the American university city of Berkeley would be named after him as would the largest library in Trinity, although the name has been officially taken off it in recent years. After all of this galavanting, Berkeley saw out his final seventeen years in Cloyne, surrounded by poverty and famine, towards which he seems to have helped.

I'm still puzzled as to how this village became such a major religious centre. Nowadays, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Cloyne encompasses all of North and East Cork, which is the chunk of the county that modern visitors leapfrog on their way to the city and West Cork. Cloyne is, as our friend might put it, the definition of the middle of nowhere. It's clear from the lack of geography why it didn't grow as a major population centre. Midleton is a few clicks north of here, connected to Cork Harbour by the Owenacurra River. Ballycotton is a gorgeous fishing village and is supposed to be Kinsale for the squeezed middle. Cobh is where the modern Catholic version of St Colman's Cathedral sits, and it is a major port, again connecting England to Ireland and the Americas. In all of these cases, the settlements connect to the outside world, but in the medieval period, the large island of Ireland must have been a world unto itself. The meeting points would have been inland, facing inwards. **Cloyne is itself a meeting point for south-east Cork, and it is a suffragen diocese for the archdiocese of Cashel (dark yellow), which is itself a meeting point for Munster people to converge and engage with the other provinces.** It's a lightbulb moment and suddenly I want to know all about how the old dioceses map onto the modern counties, or not, and, going further back, how major settlements of medieval Ireland are inland rather than coastal due to Ireland's insularity.

I punch on towards Cork Harbour and a long string of roadside, waterside houses that make up the census town of Aghada-Farsid-Rostellan. It strikes me as a less developed version of Warrenpoint where the Newry River opens out to Carlingford Lough, while the Ringsend-like tower in Aghada power station gives the area a Soviet feel, making me wonder if East Cork is itself a dissident republic within the People's Republic of Cork, somewhat akin to Transnistria in Moldova. It's pissing rain and I'm delighted to see my wife whizz by in the car. I tell her to meet me down by the lighthouse and it's a few quiet clicks out to Roche's Point, which turns out to be minor development of its own.

-   I wonder if it's been hit by like a lorry (INSERT CROSS REFERENCE TO MY LITTLE CORNER OF THE WORLD) but he says no. His job has been to pull it apart and put it back together. He's not interested in explaning the minutiae of stone masonry – *I actually learnt a little about it in Edinburgh when my flatmate was going out with a stone mason whose blether was a great lesson in the finer details of Urban Scots accents* – so I leave him at it.
