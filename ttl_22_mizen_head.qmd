\
I quietly unzip my way out of the tent, boil up some water on the camping stove and nip down for a quick dip while the water heats up. I grab my gear from the storage tent, lash it on, piece together a few leftovers from last night's dindinz, and then it's time to squeeze in slash out a half-pint of coffee from the AeroPress. I sit down to admire the stupendous views across Bantry Bay and work out the plan for the day.\
\
There's like fourteen lighthousey things in West Cork but varying degrees of access means I can't just take them on in a clean clockwise motion. But once you stall it out this way, you can just start picking them off like a sniper. I had planned to keep it simple this morning and do a handy out-and-backer to Sheep's Head, but the bike shop in Bantry told me that there is a big cycle out to Mizen Head today, and I reckon it might be fun to piggyback on top of that. It doesn't start until 9am though but I'm told registration starts at 7, so I'll just stall it there, scope out the jacker, and maybe throw some Parkinson's Law at the problem as the Mizen Head Visitor Centre doesn't open til 10am.\
\
\
taken a campsite recommendation and stalled it out to Eagle Point, a micro-peninsula on the near side of Bantry Bay, with stupendous panoramic views. I had planned to keep it simple and do a handy out-and-backer to Sheep's Head this morning, but it turns out there is a big cycle out to Mizen Head today, and it might be fun to piggyback on top of that, despite the extra distance. The only issue is that Mizen Head\
\
So we've just stalled it out to Eagle Point Campsite, between Bantry and Glengarrif, thanks to a recommendation from someone\
\
Someone in Youghal suggested this campsite to  us and it is the prettiest place I've ever slept\
\
So we've ended up in at Eagle Point Campsite, between Bantry and Glengariff, and I've decided I want to take on one of its long peninsulae this morning\
\
I'm taking on a West Cork peninsula this morning but I'm still not a hundy p whether it's gonna be an 80k out-and-backer to Sheep's Head or a longer trip to the majestic Mizen Head. I'm curled up on this air mattress still trying to finalise my plan\
\
\
West Cork has like fourteen lighthouses\
\
 and we've pitched camp at one of the prettiest spots in all of Eagle Point Campsite, perhaps the most beautiful, most organized, and most hassle-filled campsites in the country.\
\
There's time enough to savour the view across Bantry Bay which is very different from the coastline I've encountered so far.\
\
\
\
 We are in Eagle Point Campsite\
\
. Mostly it's the Beara Peninsula to  the North-West\
\
There's like fourteen lighthouses in West Cork and doing them in order isn't viable as the Old Head of Kinsale only opens in August.\
\
\
We've been camping in Eagle Point Campsite and I've been planning to head out to Sheep and/or Mizen Head while I'm down here, but it turns out there is a charity cycle on this weekend, doing the both of them.\
\

520 up, coffee, explain the difficulties of Wild Camping in Eagle Point\
- Camping\
- WAM cycle\
\
Stall in to\

market, people, charity shops, visit town, Christina, literary festival, poked my head in to the libro and got the shivers, the extraordinary lack of fun in academia,\
- gypsy market in North Cumberland St\
\
\
Schull\
- beacon on Long Island visible from on high\
- Stop to read about ferries, boaty looking person tells me the ferry runs 9-5 from Long Island and people stall over to hike for the day\
\
Make yourself at home\
- Centra is hopping, and it's a big one, the kind where you can pick up fennel. The staff are a mixed bag, possibly stacking shelves to fund a summer at the seaside. One lad looks Algerian, and two lasses sound like Portuguese-tinged Russians, so presumably Ukrainians. The clientele sport Polo shirts and shorts, and age is marked by sock length. Personality is unmarked in the attire.\
\
I ask one lad if he's out on a boat for the day or what and he says they're off to play golf in Bantry.\
\
The hot counter is loaded up with juicy sasmos and chicken fillets for an army, but my belly frowns so I just grab a coffee, stuff a banana into a plain croissant, and then plonk myself down behind the till on some garden furniture for sale. Three stacked chairs for my Gordon and a glass table for my coffee and scraps of paper, while I listen in to the requests. The Irish Times please, not the blasted Southern Star. Coffee and paracetamol to rinse the blood of last night's gargle.\

\
I say goodbye to Tim and head for the Mizen visitor centre where I take snaps of the\
\
Mizen visitor centre\
\
- on the wall are photos of lighthouses and in the corner is a map of Ireland, surrounded by like 85 photos taken by John ?Eagleton \[LINK TO PHOTOS\],\
-well arranged, and it's the best resource I've seen for lighthouses\
- lighthouse Pete suggested making a graphic of Irish ones, just like \[THIS\] American one\
- I realise that I've missed Crookhaven. I could have nipped in to see it on my way down, but I didn't realise it was there because I hadn't planned to come to Mizen today.\
- But I have to go back. While this might be top of my list of places to choose to revisit, it's bottom of my list of place that I have to come back to (rephrase), so I gotto go.\

(I thought we were doing a doublebackarooney)\
\
At a sloped T-junction near Barley Cove stand two stewards sending us left, the shorter way back to Bantry but of course I have to be awkward and turn right, back towards Crookhaven to see an unremarkable lighthouse, and I'm briefly stranded on a tiny island of gravel, while cars from three directions work out how to negotiate this stray obstacle. This is the moment I lose the other cyclists, condemning myself to a 50k return leg on my yet again Tobler. And this is how my life so often has panned out. The obstinate pursuit of obscure goals that no one asked me to do, like a (curious) dog with a phone.\
- Examples\
- Studying spelling for like a decade\
- Analysing data in Apple, like a dog with a bone, to very little avail\
- look for other earlier examples.\
- doing leaving cert maths in 2/3 year was at least useful, but set a template for, also tried O-Leval and A-level maths but they didn't really know what to do with me so those drifted off. Same\
\
- Lesson is to chart your progress and make sure there is something for others in it. Most of my Apple work went down the Swanney and my spelling thesis will sit on a dusty server, to be read by barely a handful of academics, and I need to turn that knowledge into something useful for people\
- The outcome is t\
\
\*you will in your Swiss go on your Tobler\*\
On the flip side, I get to see Barley Cove again and the delightful little beaches around Crookhaven, a charming near-island (?Tombolo) which smiles back at the mainland from a few hundred metres across the water. I'm halfway across the body of land when I realise I'm on the wrong one. The lighthouse sits on a different TOMBOLO. Frustrated, I don't bother checking out the little village, although I might be back to go on a small tour to the Fastnet at some point, as the little tours (i.e. small groups) there are supposedly more informative than the cattle-herding ferries that run from Baltimore, according to the wetser selling tickets in Mizen.\
\
Eventually I find the right tombolo but I'm heading down the wrong road with overgrown ferns and there could easily be a small cult living here unnoticed by the world. I double back and on a road marked private I see the now familiar sturdy walls of CIL, lower than usual, but unmoveable … in that British sort of tradition of us being here …\
\
Blocking my view of the lighthouse is a glassy  modern extension, and I can hear a hoover in the background, so I just take a quick snap and bounce. The scenery on the road back to the sleepy village of Goleen recedes in quality, and someone points me to a lifeless café where I sit down for a weak coffee and two sausage rolls in succession, the first one unheated, the second one scalding, but I'm delighted to put something savoury and warm in my Nedser. I'm too wrecked to think or write good notes, so I hit the road as soon as I can. Normally at this point, I'd be looking to recombobulate in a juicer with some scran, then with a clear mind, I'd take on the remaining 40k. Instead I punch on, the short way from Goleen to Durrus, past a huge ridge of rock and back on the north side of Mizen peninsula, looking back at Sheep's Head, which looks a lot less enticing under the clouds, with a clogged brain.\
\
My legs are getting tired but the terrain is annoying me. Flat land does not exist around here, but climbs seldom last long either, so you are never in a rhythm, in your legs or in your head. This is back for thought because with the constant change your brain does not get to relax. The campsite showers are like that. Every 30 seconds you have to interrupt your flow to press the button to get more water. It's the same with mobile phones, only they are more insidious as they can take out completely out of your current space, rather than just reducing the intensity.\
\
On the road to Durrus is a WAM sign with a non-ironic smiley face saying only 20k to go. Possibly another 7k to Ballylickey Pat Rafter, and I'm not in the yumour. There's a WAM feed station in Durrow with aulflas and bikes outside but I've no partner to ease the shame of gatecrashing, so I drop in to a nuclear for a swift one and packa salty peanuts. Unwatched bogball is on the box in the corner. Two more cyclists are in for a late lunch but they're not in the yumour for me. None of these people want to yap. I can't quite put my finger on it but  there's something about being an insider or, worse, a near-insider, that keeps people quiet\[\[??\]\]\
 \
\
Cork people, inane joking.\
I always feel that this must be how the English look at us. I remember when he was a player thinking that Ronan O'Gara must be thick, just from his accent. And I was shocked that his autobiography - in his early possibly thirties - was so insightful. Eventually you get over that, maybe not his silences or Sean Kelly groans - but it's basic prejudice in action.\
\
The people have a withered faces from a life of drink but functional bodies from some resuscitatory cycling.\

sland connected to the mainland by a short causeway\
\
The scenery diminishes in quality on the way back to Goleen\
\
The few chats I have are uninteresting and I understand that these journeys are for finding out how other people live or have lived, rather than meeting people doing the same thing as me, sharing tips and  \

Plan before

-   Mizen only or Mizen & sheep's head?

-   Lighthouse opening times

-   WAM route or my own

-   Baby not asleep til 230

-   

**Bantry**

-   types of people

-   street food (tick)

-   workwear

    -   cos for all the jam and cheese you hear about, someone has to fix the leaking rooves

-   bookshop

    -   semi-sorted books with a focus on the the 1980s, presumably the ageing vendor's intellectual heydey

    -   i just want to organize them (to make the shop better)

    -   Sharifa hands me a book of things that look like Ireland

        -   dig out leaf I photoed in Sligo years ago

        -   also the person who collects images of Ireland in the wild

            -   dig out photo of Mercadona in Torrevieja from June 2023

-   

-   feel like I'm on an actual holiday

-   Christina Onassis

    -   a fabulous yapper who lashes out her life story in no time at all.

    -   Her husband died at sea in a fire on a little boat, fourteen years ago, and the last thing she said to him was to nag him about getting the life jacket.

    -   sells pots and crocks.

    -   they charge by the parking space and she only takes up one, but she lays out her pots and crockery along the long stone benches the

    -   bit like the gypsy market on North Cumberland St
