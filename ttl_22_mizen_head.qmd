-   insert map of Carbery's Hundred Isles slash a map of kerry and west cork with lower sea levels

-   add gaza death toll graphic

*There are fourteen lighthouses in The Diocese of Cork and Ross – nowadays known as the sub-county of West Cork – but I don't have the time or organizational skills to take them all on in a clean clockwise motion. So I'm going to take the mathematician's approach and start by solving a bit of the problem and see if the bigger problem becomes clearer after. Or, to take Gumper's advice on doing a PhD, which is applicable to any large project: just get something done every day and it'll all come together eventually. Until I can generate larger gaps in my life, I am stuck doing one-off cycles. This is fine from a cycling viewpoint but I'm not happy about it from a narrative viewpoint. I feellike I'm done with these one day trips and I want to see what would happen to my writing if I were away for three or five or even thirty days at a time. For now though, the geography of West Cork and Kerry lends itself to one-off sniper attacks. There is a handful of finger-like penins ula, each with a lighthouse at its tip, and indeed there are many cycling events which do a loop of a peninsula. The Ring of Kerry cycle is the most famous of these, but there's the Ring of Beara too, and, I was to discover while in Bantry, the Wild Atlantic Mizen Cycle, out to Mizen Head and, for the fitter riders, out to Sheep's Head too.*

![Eagle Point camping at night](images/eagle_point_sunset.jpeg)

Bantry Square slash piazza is jammers of a Friday for its outdoor bazaar. We wander round with our daughter in the pram and the chunfla running around like a fish in water. A Polish fella my age is spinning up candy floss and pulling in four yoyos faster than a Vegas slot machine. I was expecting some kind of cultural awakening, seeing as it's the meeting point for the diffuse cultural hub that is West Cork, a remote sparseland which has been attracting hippies and artists and drop outs for decades, but I get the sense that the influx has peaked and there's a lacka chunfla NRG. This is where the late Ian Bailey sold his poetry and it seems that this realm is not about quality *per se*, but a chance to be yourself and flog a bitta whatevs in order to keep the wolf from the door. A few artists do display their output at the market but the largest stall was selling work clothes for tradespeople. Presumably that is the labour that people do be actually doing round here. Everyone needs their Union fixed and several want their gates painted. But there are not many factories and orifices or any of the other jobs that attract the bulk of the uninspired population.

I find a low wall to sit on and listen to three human relics from the old era, aulfla farmers with whiskey noses, tweed blazers, and the thickest of thick accents, like New York Jews who learnt English in a Yiddish-speakng family. Strewn along the wall and on the ground are pots and pans for sale by a lady calling herself Christina Onassis, a fabulous yapper who lashes out her life story in doublequick time. She was married to a Greek sailor who died at sea, fourteen years ago, [due to a fire on a little boat](https://www.rte.ie/news/2011/0301/298211-bantry/). The last thing she said to him was to nag him about wearing his life jacket. The regret is gushing out of her. Not because he didn't wear his lifejacket but cos she was nagging at him. What she wouldn't do to have him back. She lives up the hill now and every week she sells her pots and crocks and whatever she can get her hands on. The market only charges by the parking space, so she just buys one space for her car and puts her bits and bobs along unrented space on the square. That's the ground below our feet and the low wall opposite. We buy an Arabic flask which looks like the ones my wife would have used as a child. A pot of coffee with cardamom and a bag of sambos whenever they had to take on an entire one-hour drive.

We grab some oily scran at a feed van and I nip in to the tourist office to find out the possible jacker for my cycle in the morning. I was getting a few bits in O'Donovan's Cycles earlier on and they told me that tomorrow there is a big cycle out to Mizen Head and Sheep's Head, exactly the trips I was hoping to do myself, so I thought it might be fun to go with the flow rather then it just being me, myself and the Yvonettes, as per.

We stall off and up the hill to the libro where the West Cork Literary Festival has just begun. The atmos gives me the shivers and reminds me of staid events I used to end up at with deadpan weirdos standing about architecture and not a Britney to be seen. I would like to hear Irvine Welsh whenever he's on but you cannae dae it all. I've got books to write myself and a family to love so we all just stall it back to the playground where I grab the life story of a madzer Jungwan mammy from Castletownbere who can think of nothing but getting out of West Cork.

PIC OF SUNSET / SUNRISE in EAGLE POINT

![*Bantry Bay from Eagle Point campsite*](images/eagle_point_waters_edge.jpeg)

We are staying in a delicioso campsite on Eagle Point in Ballylickey, a few clicks north of Bantry, a few clicks south of Glengariff. It is the prettiest place I've ever slept: a perfect mix of land and water, hills and flats, rocks and plants. Big Beara Head is to the north of the bay and gimpy little Sheep's Head is to the south, while Eagle Point is a micro-peninsula at the crook of land where the bay meets the mainland. The campsite is the cleanest and most organized I've seen in Ireland, yet us tent people are essentially wild camping by the water's edge. The jacks are so far away that I use my bike to get there in a reasonable time and we take the car if we've a load of dishes to wash. The place is optimised for a twelve year old with a bike and a hurley, or even a fifteen year old looking for the shift, but the playspaces are too far away for our seven-year-old to bounce back and forth in response to the mood of the group. It feels like we are paying forty-four squids a night for a shower and access to the country we live in, seeing as the land is mostly off limits to landless plebs. The good news is that you can't spend a penny in the campsite. There's no bar, no cafe, no vending machines, no ice creams and no activities. So you don't leak fifty or a hundred squids a day on superfluities.

**0550, Saturday July 13, 2024**

I unzip my way out of the tent, boil up some water on the camping stove and nip down for a quick dip while the water heats up. I grab my gear from the storage tent, lash it on, piece together a few leftovers from last night's dindinz, and then it's time to squeeze in slash out a half-pint of coffee from my AeroPress, an excellent travel companion. I sit down to admire the views across Bantry Bay and to work out my plan for the day. My original plan was to do a simple 90k ootenbacher to Sheep's Head, but it makes sense to jump on board [The Wild Atlantic Mizen Cycle](https://wildatlanticmizencycle.com/7). There are three routes: a 65k trip for beginners, 100k to Mizen Head and back, and 130k toinclude Sheep's Head if I have it in me, although it'd be a good bit further off-road to the lighthouse.

I fix up the bike and cycle the 6k to Bantry along the N71 but it's mercifully quiet at this hour of a Sunday morning. In the tourist office, the main organizer is there now and he tells me to just punch on. I can't tell if he's sound of if he has a big bitter head on him that I haven't paid my way but it's not my fault their cycle is coinciding with mine. I'm on the defensive, inside my own head, trying to work out if I'm a scabby heartless bastard. And what if I end up taking a cup of tea and a sambo on the road?

![*You know you've been hanging out in pretty places when you start to think that this view is a bit cramped. Whiddy Island is the lowlumpy sauropod behind the boats.*](images/bantry_bay.jpeg)

It's 44k to Mizen Head, where a biteen of a lighthouse is stationed, but the vaunted visitor centre doesn't open til 10am, so I'll have to dawdle en route, as if I needed encouragement. I cycle across the empty piazza the head down to the thin strip of bay out of town. There's a few boats on the water and colourfully painted houses across the way, and the graveyard ahead of me, layered into a hill, looks resplendent in the morning sunshine. Yet the views from the town are curiously unspectacular – for the West of Ireland like – but that's because the land to sea ratio is too high and I feel hemmed in by Whiddy Island which is where Ireland's oil is delivered. At a distance of just nine furlongs, it is too near to let the town breathe fully. I first heard of the place when [Second Captains recorded a podcast](https://www.secondcaptains.com/2017/06/26/episode-890-second-captains-live-whiddy-island/) there with the uncle of Tadgh Furlong, the great Leinster prop whose banter quotient is far higher than your average Posh Robot. His mother is from the island and the uncle is the local tourism baron. If you need to get there, get around, get food, get a drink or even a bed for the night, Tim O'Leary is your only man. Literally.

![](images/clipboard-1646644829.jpeg)*"The image of the interlocking rams illustrates the Gospel story of Gideon and the Israelites who fought for many years. No one won and no one surrendered, they accepted to live together! Thus the interlocking rams symbolise togetherness and resilience." Sadly, Israel is now both David AND Goliath.*

Durrus is the village where Sheep's Head and Mizen Head converge upon the mainland and it greets visitors with an unusually interesting welcome sign. The town's name is written in Gaelic script and spelt differently from the signposts. On the ground is a flat sculpture of two rams with interlocking horns and beside that is a plaque explaining the story of Gideon and the Israelites, locked in stalemate. The use of sheep as a symbol for the community is obviously a reference to the peninsula's name, Sheep's Head, a landmass so craggy that it must have been populated more by sheep than man. The particular symbol on display is used as a trademark for the Sheep's Head Way, an 80k walk around the little finger of land. Yet it turns out that the symbol was adapted from one found on [a megalithic ston](https://corkhist.ie/wp-content/uploads/jfiles/1979/b1979-012.pdf)e in nearby Kilnaruane, dating from like the 8th or 9th Century AD.[^ttl_22_mizen_head-1]

[^ttl_22_mizen_head-1]: Kilnaruane may mean the Church of St Ruadhan, one of the twelve apostles of Ireland, but Hourihane & Hourihane (1979) argue that the name actually means Church of the Romans, and that would be due to contact with Christian Rome, rather than Mauldy Aul' Hibernia which was too Brendan to be to colonised by Julius Caesar *et alii*.

![*A digital recreation of* [the nearby Kilnaruane stone](https://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=27222) *which has been out standing in its own field since the 8th or 9th Century. The sheep are near the top right corner (of the photo, not the field).*](images/kilnaruane_stone.jpeg)

The Irish name of Durrus is a source of controversy and shows the lobotomizing effect of multiple translations between Irish and English. It means nothing in English. It is a just Anglicized spelling of the supposed Irish name *Dubh Ros*, meaning 'black wood'.[^ttl_22_mizen_head-2] However the Irish name used on signposts and in official contexts is *Dúras*, a spelling formed by mapping the meaningless English sound into a meaningless Irish sound, following conventions adopted during the highly problematic 1947 spelling standardization. The use of *Dú* for *dubh* is [in keeping with Connacht or Donegal pronunciations, but not Munster](https://www.teanglann.ie/en/fuaim/dubh), while the us of 'ras' for 'ros' makes no difference to the pronunciation. It is [mere convention](https://books.google.ie/books?id=O3wDDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA267&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false) to use 'a' in unstressed syllables instead of 'o'. Compare the Irish borrowed word *ioncam* with English *income*. Not only does the plaque remind us of the Irish words, it also used Gaelic script to do it, where a neat dot is placed on the 'b', to indicate sound change, rather than the use of a clunky 'h'.

[^ttl_22_mizen_head-2]: P.W. Joyce (1923: 79) notes that *Ross* usually means 'peninsula' in the north, but 'wood' in the south.

![*Mount Gabriel is the highest eminence in this region and the cycle up to the top is ranked as* [the 12th hardest climb](https://climbfinder.com/en/climbs/mount-gabriel) *in Ireland (2.3k \@ 10%).*](images/IMG_20240713_080146.jpg)

As the road arcs around the side of Mount Gabriel, I'm now singing *The Israelites* by Desmond Dekker and the Aces. It's a slow steady grind, leaving me plenty of time and pain to remember the poor people of Gaza who are being destroyed by those bastard Israelis. Righteousness comes easily to me but empathy seldom lands bang in my belly so it is good to map some Palestinian pain onto my own cycling and I'd love to start doing this for charity. It's very hard to believe that their impatient public mostly think the IDF are not using enough force but the army tactic is to tap away on the death count, a few dozen deaths every day. Seldom so many as to raise fresh outrage, but enough to make sure the job gets done eventually, like building a wall or climbing a mountain. Every skittle helps.

![Mount Gabriel](images/IMG_20240713_080951.jpg)

long a steady grind of a road. **It's disgusting what those sick bastards are doing to the people of Gaza and anyone who tries to help them.** A gap has been cut in the mountain to allow a road through and it's a joyous descent into Schull

<https://gsi.geodata.gov.ie/downloads/Geoheritage/Reports/CK066_Cork_CGS_Mount_Gabriel.pdf>

A pass has been cut through the lower side of the mountain and a view opens up of Schull, it's u-shaped harbour and Carbery's Hundred Isles. Taken together, it is not hard to visualize a peninsula undergirding these many islands but later today, at the Mizen Visitor Centre, I will learn that each of the skinny bays in West Cork and Kerry are *rias*, valleys that have been drownded by seawater. If the sea levels were to drop significantly – an unlikely event in our lifetimes – then the entire area would be a contiguous landmass of mountains and valleys. At the most southerly part, the "mountains" are lower, resulting in irregular scatter of, in actual fact, 50-odd discontiguous islands. The largest of these are Sherkin Island and Cape Clear, accessible from Baltimore, which I have leapfrogged. But in clear view from the side of Mount Gabriel, is skinny-ass Long Island where Copper Point Lighthouse sits, guiding ships into u-shaped Schull Harbour. I won't get there today as I have decided to by-pass the island lighthouses for now, and I'll get back to them when I can. The famous Fastnet Lighthouse sits 5k beyond Cape Clear, on a rock which might well be considered a micro-island among Carbery's Hundred Islands. Getting to such places will be an unfamiliar adventure and rather different from cycling around the mainland, counting sheep and smelling cattle manure.

The first person I meet near Schull Harbour is a Happy-Pear lookalike getting ready for a day's sailing. He tells me there are day trips to Long Island and good walking so I pocket the knowls and grab some scran across the road. Centra is hopping, and it's a big one, the kind where you can pick up fennel. The staff are an unusual mix, even for Modren Ireland. Probably buzzers stacking shelves to fund a summer on the outmost edge of Eurasia. One lad looks Algerian, and two lasses sound like Portuguese-tinged Russians, so presumably Ukrainians. The male clientele sport Polo shirts and belted shorts in preparation for golf and sailing. Age is marked by sock length. Scrumpled and low for the over-30s, tight and up to the calf for Gen Z. Individual personality is otherwise unmarked in the attire.\
\
The hot counter is loaded up with juicy sasmos and chicken fillets for an army, but my Ned Kelly frowns so I just grab a coffee, stuff a banana into a plain croissant, and then plonk myself down behind the till on some garden furniture for sale. Three stacked chairs for my Gordon, a glass table for my coffee and a clump of my own paper for notestreaming. Meantime, I listen in to the requests. *The Irish Times* please, not the blasted *Southern Star*. Coffee and paracetamol. To rinse the blood of last night's presumably gargle.

Other solutions include swimming in the sea and along the back roads out of town you've got a gang of platonics walking to the sea with towels on their shoulders and very little else on. It's already that kind of day.

I get round the bend and the view opens up of Schull and Long Island where Copper Point Lighthouse sits. I don't have time to visit it today but it's also not on my priority list because for some reason, Roger O'Reilly has omitted it from his book.

        \*you will in your Swiss go on your Tobler\*

**Crookhaven lighthouse**

On the flip side, I get to see Barley Cove again and the delightful little beaches around Crookhaven, a charming near-island (?Tombolo) which smiles back at the mainland from a few hundred metres across the water. I'm halfway across the body of land when I realise I'm on the wrong one. The lighthouse sits on a different TOMBOLO. Frustrated, I don't bother checking out the little village, although I might be back to go on a small tour to the Fastnet at some point, as the little tours (i.e. small groups) there are supposedly more informative than the cattle-herding ferries that run from Baltimore, according to the wetser selling tickets in Mizen.\
\
Eventually I find the right tombolo but I'm heading down the wrong road with overgrown ferns and there could easily be a small cult living here unnoticed by the world. I double back and on a road marked private I see the now familiar sturdy walls of CIL, lower than usual, but unmoveable … in that British sort of tradition of us being here …\
\
Blocking my view of the lighthouse is a glassy modern extension, and I can hear a hoover in the background, so I just take a quick snap and bounce. The scenery on the road back to the sleepy village of Goleen recedes in quality, and someone points me to a lifeless café where I sit down for a weak coffee and two sausage rolls in succession, the first one unheated, the second one scalding, but I'm delighted to put something savoury and warm in my Nedser. I'm too wrecked to think or write good notes, so I hit the road as soon as I can. Normally at this point, I'd be looking to recombobulate in a juicer with some scran, then with a clear mind, I'd take on the remaining 40k. Instead I punch on, the short way from Goleen to Durrus, past another huge ridge of rock and back on the north side of Mizen peninsula, looking back at Sheep's Head, which looks a lot less enticing under the clouds, with a clogged brain.\

**Undulating terrain, undulating mind**\
My legs are getting tired and the terrain is annoying me.

-   Flat land does not exist around here, but climbs seldom last long either, so you are never in a rhythm, in your legs or in your head. This is bad for thought because with the constant change your brain does not get to relax.

-   The campsite showers are like that. Every 30 seconds you have to interrupt your flow to press the button to get more water.

-   It's the same with mobile phones, only they are more insidious as they can take out completely out of your current space, rather than just reducing the intensity.

\
\
On the road to Durrus is a WAM sign with a non-ironic smiley face saying only 20k to go. It's possibly another 7k to Ballylickey Pat Rafter, and I'm not in the yumour. As I approach Durrow I come across a few groups of WAMmers but none of them are in a collaborative mood. There's a WAM feed station in Durrow with aulflas and bikes outside but I've no partner to ease the shame of gatecrashing,

so I drop in to a nuclear for a swift one and packa salty peanuts. Unwatched bogball is on the box in the corner. Two more cyclists are in for a late lunch but they're not in the yumour for me. None of these people want to yap. I can't quite put my finger on it but  there's something about being an insider or, worse, a near-insider, that keeps people quiet\[\[??\]\]

-   Few phases then dropper

    -   Check pub name

    -   hundreds of dark bikes outside, plus my bright red 90s laddie

    -   Juicer is rammed and Ireland are playing South Africa. Valentine gets lots among the crowd and we miss Ciaran Frawley knocking over a drop goal to put Ireland within a point of South Africa. IT's the kinda situation where you are asking half the pub if they've seen a chunfla on his Tobler but it seems the locals are unfamiliar with our lingo and cannot help. We find the little rascal and, miraculously, Frawley blasts over another dropper to win the game in the dying seconds. It's hard to know if I'd swap them out for the one he missed agin Toulouse a few weeks back which would have won the Heineken Cup for us. Beating South Africa in South Africa is yuge no matter how often we do it these days.

-   In the tourist office, the main organizer is there and he tells me to just punch on at my own pace. I can't tell if he's sound of if he has a bit bitter head on him that I haven't paid my way but it's not my fault their cycle is coinciding with mine.\

    I always feel that this must be how the English look at us. I remember when he was a player thinking that Ronan O'Gara must be thick, just from his accent. And I was shocked that his autobiography - in his early possibly thirties - was so insightful. Eventually you get over that, maybe not his silences or Sean Kelly groans - but it's basic prejudice in action.\

    taken a campsite recommendation and stalled it out to Eagle Point, a micro-peninsula on the near side of Bantry Bay, with stupendous panoramic views. I had planned to keep it simple and do a handy out-and-backer to Sheep's Head this morning, but it turns out there is a big cycle out to Mizen Head today, and it might be fun to piggyback on top of that, despite the extra distance. The only issue is that Mizen Head

    -   There's like fourteen lighthousey things in West Cork but varying degrees of access means I can't just take them on in a clean clockwise motion. But

-   PIC OF SHARIFA, DUDU and VALENTINE with candy floss

-   I had originally planned to keep it simple this morning and do a simple 90k ootenbacher to Sheep's Head, but I was in the bike shop in Bantry yesterday and they told me there is a big cycle out to Mizen Head today,

-   The cycle doesn't start until 9am but yesterday I popped in to Bantry tourist office and they told me that registration starts there at 7.

-   No one here is young and a quick check of the census shows that Bantry has one of the oldest populations in the country. It seems that the West of Ireland is riddled with old people and it's a reminder that very little has ever been done to reverse the outward flow of young working-age people. ADD VIDEO OF MAYO IN THE 80s.

-   

-   **A curiosity of Bantry is that it has one of the oldest populations in the country with the median age being like 44. CHECK CSO**

-   I am lucky enough to sit on a bench with three aulflas yapping away in the thickest of thick accents. CHECK NOTES.

    -   Bray and Sligo

-   The closest thing to this in Dublin is the gypsy bit like the gypsy market on North Cumberland St

-   The group cycle has three routes, 65k, 100k and 130k. The longest one goes to Mizen Head and then takes on a chunk of Sheep's Head, but doesn't go as far as the lighthouse.

I wonder if the interlocked sheep also represent the two peninsula, one to the left of the drowned valley and one to the right, the two conjoined here at Durrus slash Dúras slash duḃros slash Dubh Ros.

-   and then it's inland from here to Durrus where Mizen Head and Sheep's Head are split by the smaller Dunmanus Bay.
