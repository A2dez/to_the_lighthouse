**0559, December 1, 2024**

Duty forced me to kip at home last night and I was a smidgeen late getting out cos the no-longer bambino was irreconcilable for the last hour. I'm driving directo to Cork and from there I'll hug the coast to the Old Head of Kinsale where the lighthouse has been locked up for thirty years inside a near-militarised golf course for Yanks. If this book was called *In the lighthouse*, then I'd be concerned, but it's about the task of getting *to* the lighthouse, so I've decided to get Roy of the Rover it and punch on inanyways. I feellike I'm getting to understand the cobbled-together road from Wicklow to Cork which forms a smoothish arc around the south-east of Ireland, between the quick zip of the M11 and the coast-skirting beauty of the N25, duct-taped together by the R-like N30, and the whole ensemble being cable-tied at Enniscorthy. I feellike we should lash in an orbital motorway around the whole island, joining the urban dots, with a railline running paraloopallel. [Most Irish people](https://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/ep/p-cp2tc/cp2pdm/pd/) live near the coast so it makes sense to have a Big Fukov ring road to complement the existing half-wheel of spokes radiating from the capital. The current set up means that travel betwong all the other cities is a bit of a Kenmare.

![*Passage West, Cork Harbour: I've about two stone of spare clothes hanging out the back of it, between civvies for tonight and a full change of winter cycling gear for when it rains later.*](images/passage_west_ready_to_go.jpeg)

There's two sides to every harbour so this time I'm taking in the west side of Cork Harbour, from Passage West to Crosshaven, then turning right slash west for Kinsale where the Wild Atlantic Way officially starts. Ideally I would park in Cork City and re-cycle the greenway to Passage but these short winter days leave little room for redundancy, curiosity or faffing, so I drive directo to my start point. I miss my turn off and get telescoped into Cork City which is looking garjus this marnin' and I'm #welljeal of the punters I see getting coffee along the Marina Greenway on the south side of the river. I park in Passage and get ready to Rock'n'Ryle Nugent. I won't be back here til tomorrow morning as I'll be kipping in Cork City so I have to bring civvies and spare cycling gear for the coming rain, all loaded in my rainproof bag on the bike's childseat. I do however have enough spare clothes to clothe a carload of summertime festival-goers. One in cycling shorts and a Gilet. One in longjohns with a high-viz, another in your classic Love Parade combo of boxers and a cycling-jersey, and lastly a Bruce Springsteen fan in jeans and a white t-shirt. Plus a few jackets if the weather turns. For now, though, it's the nicest day you'll ever see in an Irish December and the temperature of thirteen degrees means I don't miss the gloves I've forgotten.

![*Sometimes you have to think long and hard to come up with a double-barrel rhyming slang and sometimes they just jump out of the box.*](images/brendan_butchers.jpeg)

I ask an aulfla for directions, hoping for the chats but he's a bit of a nause so he's there telling me all about T-junctions in Belgooly, 25k from here as the car flies. I decide to just follow the Eurovelo 1 route as it tends to do quite a thorough skirting of the coast and its signposts take away most of the decision-making. Both Eurovelo and your man advise against seeing Ringaskiddy, with its ferry port and heavy industry, but that's exactly why I should be going there and I'm kicking myself for following two variants of the same advice. Before long I'm in Monkstown and the Bosun pub is luring me in. Recommended on the Eurovelo website. I can already see conflict over the next few thousand k between this waymarked cycling route and my mercurial approach to travel.

### Carrigaline-up

Nonethenevertheless, curiosity quickly takes control of the sitch and I nip in to Avondale Football Club to watch two teams of men no better than me playing ball. I wonder if I'd still have it. I've just read Ciaran Murphy's diary of a GAA player aged 39¾ and he nearly had me signing up for my local club. What better way to get to know my new home town? Unprompted, the lifer on the door apologetically explains what I've stumbled across, assuring me that this is their junior team and it's the same for the opposition. It's a local derby but within the FAI Junior Cup competition so they coulda been drawn against a team from Dublin or Donegal. He's clearly disappointed not to be off on a cheeky weekend somewhere far away, the kind of involuntary Szechuan with The Lads that your missus can't say no to. Eventually, the College Corinthians' centre half hoofs the ball sixty yards off the field of play, a tactic I'd've been steeped in myself, and I'm just looking at it going, "On your bike, mate". So I punch on and soon emerge at the ford slash commuter town of Carrigaline. From this entrance point, the place is a gigantic graveyard, watched over by some ageing council houses and a dated set of business units from the best-forgotten 80s. I cross the short bridge and slingshot along a greenway out to Crosshaven where a series of micro-marinae emerge round each elegant bend of the Owenabue Estuary before opening up into the majesty of Cork Harbour. On the far side of the water is the Soviet Republic of East Cork, with its fat chimney puffing goodo in the winter sun. Later on today, Michael O'Leary (the sound one) would assure me that East Cork is no dissident republic. The rest of the county have been trying to ditch them since God knows when but they refuse to Foxtrot Oscar.

### **Crosshaven**

![*The Owenabue River meets Cork Harbour at Crosshaven, making it a haven within a haven, sheltered double from D'Atlantic Ocean over the hill on the right.*](images/crosshaven_cork_harbour.jpeg)

Crosshaven is a haven within a haven or harbour within a harbour, cognate with the name of the Danish capital København. The village sits on the sheltered side of headland whose other two sides back onto Cork Harbour and the Celtic Sea slashtag the Atlantic Ocean. I used to think a *haven* was another word for *heaven*, but its figurative sense of 'refuge' seems to have come later, presumably from sailors filled with gratitude on arrival from the perils of sea. No doubt the semantic overlap is fuelled by the similarity of the words and the achingly complex history of the English vowel system (compare, for example, *Derby County* with *Seamus Darby*). But for those of you learning English who feel there are too many vowels to learn, spare a thought for learners of Danish whose peninsular language has maintained perhaps twenty-six vowel distinctions and not had the simplifying luxury of doing a morphorooney with a Romance language like French.

The 'cross' in Crosshaven is marked by a hardworking mini-roundabout which takes in traffic from three sloped entrance-exits and one flat road that follows the water round towards Cork Harbour. I mosey into the brunch-loaded *Rivers End Cafe* and negotiate my way onto a little wicker couch normally used for punters waiting. I need a few minutes of warmth. There's space aplenty to sit outside and watch fashionable couples parading their Sunday Best: fluffy dogs and multi-coloured fleece coats decorated with semi-irregular patterns inherited from music videos from the unremembered 90s. Absolutely no one is in the yumour for the random chats. I was hoping that a bit of winter misery would bring out the best of the west but I've managed to arrive here on the only happy morning of the entire season. Plus, this village is a long way from the wisht of Ireland. It's a handy refuge – or haven – for city people and Sunday morning is the one hiatus in their lives where they can mingle in peace and spent #qualitytime with loved ones. They don't want to talk to strangers today. During business hours, by contrast, employees are often happy to yap, thankful for a welcome diversion from their quotidian monotony. I see now why Paul Theroux hates National Holidays so much. So I decide to head for the ocean on the far side of the protective headland because the pleasantness of Crosshaven is sucking the life out of me.

![*Weaver's Point marks the western entrance to Cork Harbour with Roche's Point Lighthouse faintly visible on the eastern side.*](images/weavers_point_crosshaven2.jpeg)

It's a tiny puncheur's hill up to Weaver's Point and out the other side are spectacular views of Roche's Head lighthouse, a statute mile away, although its stubby little campus and is too small for my zoomless camera which seems to have been damaged this morning. All of my pics are now blurred for some reason. It's good to be at the sea though and I'm ready for some coastal undulations. Seemingly there's a shortcut to Myrtleville beach but Google Maps is asking me to override a Cul de Sac sign and cycle up a steep narrow laneway, so I respectfully double back and take the long route via Crosshaven village.

### **Myrtleville Beach**

![*According to Ireland's morkeshing peeps, I haven't gotten to the worthwhile part of Cork*](images/Myrtleville_beach_edited.jpeg)

Myrtleville Beach is a poor man's Dunmore East, a funnel of wet sand nestled among mid-sized cliffs with people hovering on the fringes, but I bet it's compactness is a major boon to its atmos of a summer's Doris. I gawk at its beauty for a bit and turn to go but a massive bee falls off the back of motorcyclist's head and I ask him and his companion if they had seen it but they hadn't. Finally I've got a live yapper, blaring out his Cork City accent. Shrill, undulating and nasal, yet offset by its relentless wit. He tells me you sometimes get a bee in your helmet and you've gotta be caaalm, and we get yapping about seeing the coastline, him on a motorbike, me on the push bike and we agree that it's the best way to see the world. I quip that it's probably just as good on a horse, and we both laugh. The joke ought to be my cue to go but, living among the flatwitted people of Wicklow Town, my banter quotient has fallen off a cliff and I forget to bounce. I'm still standing there like a gobsheen and he pats me on the shoulder and says right go on there now lad.

### Fountainstown

I cycle off the mortification on the steep exit from Myrtleville beach and two clicks later I'm in Fountainstown, the site of one of the more mortifying episodes of my Sonic Youth.

### **Road to Kinsale –\> joining the Wild Atlantic Caelan**

![*Belgooly probably means "tonsils" in Irish.*](images/belgooly_beal_guala.jpeg)

I don't have time for a spin out to Robert's Cove and back along the coastal distributor road so I cut across the countryside via Belgooly. Being inland is a welcome break from the ever-changing waterfront landscapes. I zone out as hedges and the green desert fill the land, and neither a cow nor farmer is to be seen. *This is Belgium.* A pong of wet dung explodes from a farmyard and the sweet smell of haylage reminds me of my dad's old shop. Belgooly, with its silly name, has me making silly bilingual puns and I forget to pull over and refuel, so I have no choice but to tuck into my emergency reserves. A party can of Brewdog ale. I'm delighted with myself, nailing a Britney for medicinal purposes. The little climb before Kinsale welcomes me to the Wild Atlantic Doris at long last and soon I descend into the famous town. It's bigger and uglier than I remember, with grey buildings stacked up on a hill. I kipped in Kinsale once during the Cork Jazzless Festival but it turns out that Chronor's gaff was in the nearby village of Summercove. Charles Fort lighthouse is there but there's not enough light for me to visit it today so I'll just stall out there at the start of my next trip.

![Lighthouse, ](images/old_head_of_kinsale_lighthouse.jpeg)

The trip from here to the Old Head of Kinsale is a 30k ootenbacker and I'm anxious to offload the yoodj bag on my back along with its childseat holder. Ideally I'd leave them in a cafe or juicer but I'm not in the yumour for buttering anyone up, nor do I have time, so I just lob them under a weird modern-art sculpture opposite the Tourist Office, and lock one to the other. Then I zip off like an unleashed husky, out of the town on the riverside road and then across a long flat boring bridge built in the 1970s but named after a gas character known as Archeadon Tom Duggan who was always looking for adventure. He served as a chaplain in both the First and Second World Wars, played a role in the Irish revolutionary years, and later set about revitalising Kinsale. He later become archdeacon of Cork but got bored and ended up in Peru as a missionary, like so many Irish priests and nuns, a worldly bunch who always gave great Mass.

The geography leading out to the Old Head is a little odd. First off there is one of those pointless-peninsulas that I've gotten used to in Waterford and East Cork: a chunk of coastal land stranded between two river estuaries. Sticking out of it is a classic pointy peninsula and there's an even more classic head – the Old Head of Kinsale – which is connected to the mainland by a teeny skinny rocky isthmus. It's not a tombolo, however, as it's not made of sand, and there's actually a bit of a climb up to it. To the right on high is a signal tower and a museum dedicated to the infamous Lusitania boat which sank near this part of the coast. Fortunately it's closed so I can't waste precious light reading about Hugh Lane and the other 2000 passengers who were torpedoed by a German *Unterseeboot*.

**Kinsale golf course**

I stop off in a boozer for a six-minute pit stop, a la Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent. One pint and one packet of peanuts. And where's your charger? The barman tells me about the brouhaha in the 90s over access to the Old Head. The first weekend they opened the golf course, a few dozen Yanks were flown in on helicopters and the plebs have been locked out since. He tells me who to contact next time if I'm looking for a tour. I'm back on the road and in Kinsale just before dark. My legs are feeling great now and I sprint the last couple of clicks, then roll along the river and back to my excess baggage in town. I have a shower in a hotel gym and I'm ready for a pleasant blast of civility in the town. Kids are queueing up for Santa and there's a buzz about.

a restaurant, but I first need to check the jacker with the Boola Bus. Twenty minutes from now

Every hour. Be grand. Mono told me I could lob

golf and rambling did not mix.

-   like dogs and bicycles

**Kinsale return**

-   Atmos is horroof, reminds me of Killarney or Taormina.

-   **I text the Jerseys for some restaurant reccos, and I'm met with a slew or responses. I had forgotten that that WhatsApp group began as a way of organizing their trip to the Kinsale 7s and later morphed into a larger group which now includes like half of our year in school.**

-   like many of the good ones, as a way on keeping

-   specifying that I have no interest in going anywhere I would have to worry about my volume or posture.

-   So I head or the bus and the driver won't let me load up the bike. There's a wodge of space in the hold but I know Bus Eireann drivers, sticklers for the unreasonable rules.

    -   Sorry, sir, you'll have to fold the pram before getting on the bus?

        -   Oh really? So I'll just fold up the pram, pick it up with one hand, grab my toddler with the other and then leave her aoone on the bus while I come back for my shopping.

    -   Sorry, sir, is that food hot? You'll have to leave it in the hold

    -   Sorry, sir, you can't fold up your bike and leave it in the hold.

-   Thankfully there's a taxi company nearby so I go in and I'm delighted to be met by fresh cigarette smoke because it means the lady on the desk won't be a stickler for rules. She says the bus driver is some wanker and hopefully Andy will sort me out. Fifty quid to the city. I'm happy to take it and get the flock out of this tourist trap. Mick O'Leary is out having pints for his sister's birthday so I know I have some actual Cork bants ahead of me.

-   Andy turns out to be an Irish citizen whose first eighteen years were spent in the People's Republic of China and the last eighteen have been in the real People's Republic. He's a quality taxi driver and he hates foreigners coming over here and getting free houses. Like a lot of The Pope's Children, he got mangled by the Celtic Tiger but he recently managed to flog his apartment in Douglas and buy a family home in Kinsale in an old council

**Finale..**

**Sheila's Hostel**

Beyond the usual clusters of French and Italian students on tour, the hostel is populated by the working homeless, fellas my age with bodies worn out from hostel-hopping between shifts. Two of them are discussing their sleeping arrangements. Here for three nights and then off to Cashel. God love him. That place is a Brad Swiss and, thanks to *Booking.com*, I accidentally put my family through a night there with commotion all round. The other fella says there's a decent hostel in Glengarriff, handy cos he's working in Castletownbere. Reminds me not be cycling on those roads if I can help it.

In the morning, mute Eastern European lads prep a backpack for the day and start smoking as they walk off into the pre-sunrise light, stomping their steel-capped boots down the steep hill. I'm having trouble getting my bike from terrace round the back but luckily one of the lads out having a smoke for breakfast recognises me and puts his companion at ease. He was bricking it that he'd be seen on camera aiding someone access the hostel through the back door.

I have time enough for scramblies in a cafe cos I'm Hankers now but I wish I was back in Bus Stop cafe listening to the proprietor's city accent. Shrill, undulating and nasal, yet somehow soothing. I cycle out to the Marina Market for some snaps then out the greenway to Passage East. The smell of curry reminds me of my wife's dinners and I'm ready to go home. Ideally, I'd take the ferry to Great Island and visit Spike Island but that'll have to wait and before I know it I've rounded the east side of the city and getting a slingshot home along the N25 in the bright easterly sunshine.

*It has been 30 hour jolly with eight hours of driving, six hours of cycling, five hours' kip, four hours' drinking and fock all faffing. A lot of people would be delighted with this result but I haven't soaked up enough of the characters, even though I've very much felt the character of the place.*

-   even the return leg is a bit tight as I've to be home to collect my son from school at half-two

    -   this means I've a chance to revisit the greenway to Passage and scope out the post-industrial skronk along the Cork Marina without any of you cunts keeping an eye on my movements.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Car journeyN

-   squeezed through the telescopic-shaped road into to Cork city, slower and narrower in phases, until you are jammed in the city's traffic.

-   It's a garjus marning in Cark, goosebumps etc

so I have to drive straight there, park for 24 hours and get down to business.

tomorrow I'll do that cycle without worrying about you lot looking over my shoulder

**Accent**

-   high-pitched, undulatating and nasal, yet they are still sound.

**Drive to Passage**

-   There's two sides to every harbour so I'm heading back Cork City planning to head down the west side of the harbour this time. Duty forced me to kip at home last night and I was a smidgeen late getting out cos the no-longer bambino was irreconcilable for an hour. I'm getting very familiar now with the road that arcs around the south-east of the country, between the quickshot N11 and the coast-skirting N25, duct-taped together by the R-like N30 and sewn up with a cable tie in Enniscorthy. It makes me wonder if we could lash in a donut road around Ireland, seeing as nearly everyone lives on the coast. Bonus points for including a trainline and top marks if we add an extra-Large Hadron Collider.

-   It'd clean up the journey from Waterford to Donegal despite the extra distance. We could probably lob in a polyrail and maybe even throw in an extra-Large Hadron Collider while we're #atit.

I have the lads onto My Bloody Valentine and they insist I try out Steely Dan. Now I've done my Steely Dan penance already because back as a lad, while I was monstering Can and The Velvet Underground for breakfast, lunch and dinner, I also ploughed my way through, like, *Q* magazine's Top 100 albums of all time. So I know how little I like Bob Dylan and The Byrds or anything jangly like REM's early works, and I also know how much I hate fusion wank like Steely Dan. But now, twenty-plus years later, I'm willing to see if I've mellowed out enough to bathe in their chill atmos. After all, I now volunteer my way through Tom Petty albums when I'm cleaning the gaff and The Orb have me listening to Harry Nilssen whose voice is "a direct portal to God". But the Aja album does nothing but annoy me. It's slow but there's no groove. The instrumentation sounds a wee bit complex but there's

**Crosshaven**

The businesses seems to be a mix of local pride and generic meh so I head straight for La Scala with its large colourful letter-lights but that turns

It's all very nice in Crosshaven. The boats looks deloosh in the sunshine, I find boat masts to be an unsightly mess, like having a windfarm squashed into your town. The centre is a small roundabout which takes in traffic from three hilly entrance-exits and one flat road that loops left along the sea. The businesses seems to be a mix of local pride and generic shite so I head straight for La Scala with its large colourful letterin \[LOOK UP\]

-   People finally have time for themselves so yapping to you is of no benefit to them. During the week they are in work and friendly chat is often a welcome break from the monotony of work.

-   , via Crosshaven and then on to the Old Head of Kinsale lighthouse which only lets visitors in on two days of the year, neither of which is today or any day soon.

-   

-   I used to think the word meant *heaven*, but that seems to have come after, given how similar the words are and how thankful sailers must be of the haven on arrival. No doubt the confusion is caused by the phenomenoally complext history of the English vowel system - see Roger Lass. But for those of you learning English who think you have two many vowels to learn, spare a thought for learners of Danish whose peninsular language has maintained twenty-eight vowel distinctions, possibly due to its never being merged with a Romance language, as has been the case for the French influence on English.

It strikes me as insane now that anyone would ever go anywhere and not do a quick inspection of its geography

The road to Kinsale is full-onnThis is Belgium territory and the angled trees are the first indication that I'm in a different geological space because they are no longer protected by the large and steep hills by the sea. I'm surrounded by the green desert and the pong of cattle turd hits me hard even though you only see a herd in every twenty-eighth field, plus an ageless permofeatch farmer.

I'm nearly in Kinsale and I've got no water or food left but I have packed a ouple of party cans in my mála for a physical or emotional emergency so I lash one out and tuck in thirstily before arriving at a sign saying *Welcome to the Wild Atlantic Way*.
