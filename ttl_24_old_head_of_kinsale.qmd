**0559, December 1, 2024**

Duty forced me to kip at home last night and I was a smidgeen late getting out cos the no-longer bambino was irreconcilable for the last hour. I'm driving directo to Cork and from there I'll hug the coast to the Old Head of Kinsale where the lighthouse has been locked up for thirty years inside a near-militarised golf course for Yanks. If this book was called *In the lighthouse*, then I'd be concerned, but it's about the task of getting *to* the lighthouse, so I've decided to get Roy of the Rover it and punch on inanyways. I feellike I'm getting to understand the cobbled-together road from Wicklow to Cork which forms a smoothish arc around the south-east of Ireland, between the quick zip of the M11 and the coast-skirting beauty of the N25, duct-taped together by the R-like N30, and the whole ensemble being cable-tied at Enniscorthy. I feellike we should lash in an orbital motorway around the whole island, joining the urban dots, with a railline running paraloopallel. [Most Irish people](https://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/ep/p-cp2tc/cp2pdm/pd/) live near the coast so it makes sense to have a Big Fukov ring road to complement the existing half-wheel of spokes radiating from the capital. The current set up means that travel betwong all the other cities is a bit of a Kenmare.

![*Passage West, Cork Harbour: I've about two stone of spare clothes hanging out the back of it, between civvies for tonight and a full change of winter cycling gear for when it rains later.*](images/passage_west_ready_to_go.jpeg)

There's two sides to every harbour so this time I'm taking in the west side of Cork Harbour, from Passage West to Crosshaven, then turning right slash west for Kinsale where the Wild Atlantic Way starts officially. Ideally I would park in Cork City, where I'm kipping tonight, and re-cycle the greenway to Passage but these short winter days leave little room for redundancy, curiosity or faffing, so I drive directo to my start point. I miss my turn off and get telescoped into a Cork City looking garjus in the sunshine and I'm welljeal of the punters I see getting coffee along the Marina Greenway on the other side of the wide river. I weave out to Passage, park by the river slash lake and get ready to Rock'n'Ryle Nugent. I won't be back here til tomorrow morning so I have to bring civvies for tonight and spare cycling gear for the coming rain, all loaded in my rainproof bag on the bike's childseat. I have enough spare clothes to clothe a carload of summertime festival-goers. One in cycling shorts and a Gilet. One in longjohns with a high-viz, another in your classic Love Parade combo of boxers and a cycling-jersey, and lastly a Bruce Springsteen fan in jeans and a white t-shirt. Plus a few jackets if the weather turns. For now, though, it's the nicest day you'll ever see in an Irish December and the temperature of thirteen degrees means I don't miss the gloves I've forgotten.

![*Sometimes you have to think long and hard to come up with a double-barrel rhyming slang and sometimes they just jump out of the box.*](images/brendan_butchers.jpeg)

I ask an aulfla for directions, hoping for the chats but he's a bit of a nause so he's there telling me all about T-junctions in Belgooly, 25k from here as the car flies. I decide to just follow the Eurovelo 1 route as it tends to do quite a thorough skirting of the coast and its signposts take away most of the decision-making. Both Eurovelo and your man advise against seeing Ringaskiddy, with its ferry port and heavy industry, but that's exactly why I should be going there and I'm kicking myself for following two variants of the same mainstream advice. Before long I'm in Monkstown and the Bosun pub is luring me in. Recommended on the Eurovelo website. I can already see conflict over the next few thousand k between this waymarked cycling route and my mercurial approach to travel.

### Carrigaline-up

Nonethenevertheless, curiosity quickly takes control of the sitch and I nip in to Avondale Football Club to watch two teams of men no better than me playing ball. I wonder if I'd still have it. I've just read Ciaran Murphy's diary of a GAA player aged 39¾ and he nearly had me signing up for my local club. What better way to get to know my new home town? Unprompted, the lifer on the door apologetically explains what I've stumbled across, assuring me that this is their junior team and it's the same for the opposition. It's a local derby but within the FAI Junior Cup competition so they coulda been drawn against a team from Dublin or Donegal. He's clearly disappointed not to be off on a cheeky weekend somewhere far away, the kind of involuntary Szechuan with The Lads that your missus can't say no to. Eventually, the College Corinthians' centre half hoofs the ball sixty yards off the field of play, a tactic I'd've been steeped in myself, and I'm just looking at it going, "On your bike, mate".

So I punch on and soon emerge at the ford slash commuter town of Carrigaline. From this entrance point, the place is a gigantic graveyard, watched over by some ageing council houses and a dated set of business units from the best-forgotten 80s. I cross the short bridge and slingshot onto a greenway out to Crosshaven where a series of micro-marinae emerge round each elegant bend of the Owenabue Estuary before opening up into the majesty of Cork Harbour. On the far side of the water is the Soviet Republic of East Cork, with its fat chimney puffing goodo in the winter sun. Later on today, Michael O'Leary (the sound one) will assure me that East Cork is no dissident republic. The rest of the county have been trying to ditch them since God knows when but they refuse to Foxtrot Oscar.

### **Crosshaven**

![*The Owenabue River meets Cork Harbour at Crosshaven, making it a haven within a haven, sheltered double from D'Atlantic Ocean over the hill on the right.*](images/crosshaven_cork_harbour.jpeg)

Crosshaven is a haven within a haven or harbour within a harbour, cognate with the name of the Danish capital *København*. The village sits on the sheltered side of headland whose other two sides back onto Cork Harbour and the Celtic Sea slashtag Atlantic Ocean. I used to think a *haven* was another word for *heaven*, but it turns out to be merely a 'refuge'. The semantic blurring can surely be explained by two forces. There is not much of an emotional jump between *finding heaven* and *taking refuge* from the perils of the sea. This figurative leap must surely be amplified by the similar sound of the words, and that in turn fuelled by the achingly complex history of the English vowel system. Compare, for example, *Derby County* with *Seamus Darby*, or *earth* and *hearth*. But for those of you learning English who feel there are too many vowels to learn, spare a thought for learners of Danish whose penisolated language has maintained perhaps twenty-six vowel distinctions and not had the simplifying luxury of doing a morphorooney with a Romance language like French.

The 'cross' in Crosshaven is marked by a hardworking micro-roundabout which takes in traffic from three sloped entrance-exits and one flat road that follows the water round towards Cork Harbour. I mosey into the brunch-loaded *Rivers End Cafe* and negotiate my way onto a little wicker couch normally used for punters waiting. I need a few minutes of indoor warmth. There's space aplenty to sit outside and watch fashionable couples parading their Sunday Best: fluffy dogs and multi-coloured fleece coats decorated with semi-irregular patterns inherited from music videos from the unremembered 90s. Absolutely no one is in the yumour for the random chats. I was hoping that a bit of winter misery would bring out the best of the west but I've managed to arrive here on what might be the only happy morning of the entire winter. Plus, this village is a long way from the real wisht of Ireland. PsychoMcLogically, like. It's a handy refuge – or haven – for city people and Sunday morning is the one hiatus in their lives where they can mingle in peace and spent #qualitytime with loved ones. They don't want to talk to strangers today. During business hours, by contrast, employees are often happy to yap, thankful for a welcome diversion from their quotidian monotony. I see now why Paul Theroux hates National Holidays so much. So I decide to head for the ocean on the far side of the protective headland because the pleasantness of Crosshaven is sucking up my lust for strife.

![*Weaver's Point marks the western entrance to Cork Harbour with Roche's Point Lighthouse faintly visible on the eastern side.*](images/weavers_point_crosshaven2.jpeg)

It's a tiny puncheur's hill up to Weaver's Point and out the other side are spectacular views of Roche's Head lighthouse, a statute mile away, although its stubby little campus and is too small for my zoomless camera which seems to have been damaged this morning. All of my pics are now blurred for some reason. It's good to be at the sea though and I'm ready for some coastal undulations. Seemingly there's a shortcut to Myrtleville beach but Google Maps is asking me to override a Cul de Sac sign and cycle up a steep narrow laneway, so I respectfully double back and take the long route via Crosshaven village.

### **Myrtleville Beach**

![*According to Ireland's morkeshing peeps, I haven't gotten to the worthwhile part of Cork yet*](images/Myrtleville_beach_edited.jpeg)

Myrtleville Beach is a poor man's Dunmore East, a funnel of wet sand nestled among mid-sized cliffs with people hovering on the fringes, and not much of village, but I bet it's compactness is a major boon to its atmos of a summer's Doris. I gawk at its beauty for a bit and turn to go but a massive bee falls off the back of motorcyclist's head and I ask him and his companion if they had seen it but they hadn't. Finally I've got a live one, blaring out his Cork City accent. Shrill, undulating and nasal but offset by warmth and wit. He tells me you sometimes get a bee in your helmet and you've gotta be caaalm, and we get yapping about seeing the coastline, him on a motorbike, me on the push bike and we agree that it's the best way to see the world. I quip that it's probably just as good on a horse, and we both laugh. The joke ought to be my cue to go but, living now among the flatwitted people of Wicklow Town, my banter quotient has fallen off a cliff and I forget to bounce. I'm still standing there like a gobsheen and he pats me on the shoulder and says right go on there now lad.

### Fountainstown

I cycle off the mortification on the steep exit from Myrtleville beach and two clicks later I'm in Fountainstown, the site of one of the more mortifying episodes of my Sonic Youth.

### **Road to Kinsale –\> joining the Wild Atlantic Caelan**

![*Belgooly probably means "tonsils" in Irish.*](images/belgooly_beal_guala.jpeg)

I don't have time for a spin out to Robert's Cove and back along the coastal distributor road so I cut across the countryside via Belgooly. Being inland is a welcome break from the ever-changing waterfront landscapes. I zone out as hedges and the green desert fill the land, and neither a cow nor farmer is to be seen. *This is Belgium.* A pong of wet dung explodes from a farmyard and the sweet smell of haylage reminds me of my dad's old shop. Belgooly, with its silly name, has me making silly bilingual puns and I forget to pull over and refuel, so I have no choice but to tuck into my emergency reserves. A party can of Brewdog ale. I'm delighted with myself, nailing a Britney for medicinal purposes. The little climb before Kinsale welcomes me to the Wild Atlantic Doris at long last and soon I descend into the famous town. It's bigger and uglier than I remember, with grey buildings stacked up on a hill. I kipped in Kinsale once during the Cork Jazzless Festival but it turns out that Chronor's gaff was in the nearby village of Summercove. Charles Fort lighthouse is there but there's not enough light for me to visit it today so I'll just stall out there at the start of my next trip.

The trip from here to the Old Head of Kinsale is a 30k ootenbacker and I'm anxious to offload the yoodj bag on my back along with its childseat holder. Ideally I'd leave them in a cafe or juicer but I'm not in the yumour for buttering anyone up, nor do I have time with the light, so I just lob them under a weird modern-art sculpture opposite the Tourist Office, and lock one to the other. Then I zip off like an unleashed husky, out of the town on the riverside road and then across a long flat boring bridge built in the 1970s but named after a gas character known as Archdeacon Tom Duggan who was always looking for adventure. He served as a chaplain in both the First and Second World Wars, played a role in the Irish revolutionary years, and later set about revitalising Kinsale. He later become archdeacon of Cork but got bored and ended up in Peru as a missionary, like so many Irish priests and nuns, a worldly bunch who always give great Mass.[^ttl_24_old_head_of_kinsale-1]

![*The derelict castle at the entrance to the Old Head of Kinsale shows that the Golf Course owners, with their spiky, hard to clim gates, are only the latest set of owners to block off this ballock of land.* ](images/old_head_of_kinsale_entrance.jpeg)

The geography leading out to the Old Head is unusual. First off there is one of those pointless-peninsulas that I've gotten used to in Waterford and East Cork: a chunk of coastal land stranded between two river estuaries. Sticking out of it though is a classic pointy peninsula and beyond that is an even more classic round head – the Old Head of Kinsale – which is connected to the mainland by a teeny skinny rocky isthmus. It's not a tombolo, however, as it's not made of sand, and there's actually a bit of an incline up to it. To the right on high is a signal tower and a museum dedicated to the infamous Lusitania boat which sank near this part of the coast. Fortunately it's closed so I can't waste precious light reading about Hugh Lane and the other 2000 passengers who were torpedoed by a German *Unterseeboot*.

![*The lighthouse is locked up inside a private golf course with big fuck-off American gates at the entrance.*](images/old_head_of_kinsale_lighthouse.jpeg){alt="The lighthouse is locked up inside a private golf course with big fuck-off American gates at the entrance."}

The lighthouse is only accessible on occasional open days but punters come out here for the barseways views east and west, but there's no view south as the ball-point head itself is locked away behind big fuck-off American gates. Moaning about the situation is a good talking point and, on my return leg, I stop off in a boozer for a six-minute pit stop, a la Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent. One pint and one packet of peanuts. And where's your charger? The barman tells me about the brouhaha in the 90s over access to the Old Head. The first weekend they opened the golf course, a few dozen Yanks were flown in on helicopters and us Plebs have been locked out since. Apparently golf and rambling don't mix. He tells me who to contact next time if I'm looking for a tour. The most similar situation is in Wicklow Town but they've managed to keep a cliff walk for the locals around the golf course and, if you're cheeky, you can walk to the lighthouses that way.

#### Rewind

I'm back on the road and in Kinsale just before dark. My legs are feeling great now and I sprint the last couple of clicks, then roll along the river and back to my excess baggage in town. I manage to blag a shower in a hotel gym and I'm ready for a pleasant blast of civility in the town. Kids are queueing up for Santa and there's a buzz about. But before I settle down for some nosebag, I need to check the jacker with the Boola Bus. They're every hour. Should be grand. Mono told me I could lob my Paul van in the hold. But when the first driver arrives, he tells me I can't bring my bike. They've got those half-arsed new Bog Eireen buses. Double decker buses that can't carry a pram or any excess baggage. I'm not in the Emer for Kinsale now as the atmos is horroof. Full of plodding tourists and unwelcoming locals. Reminds me of Killarney or Taormina, only dark, half-lit and half out of season. Thankfully there's a taxi company nearby so I stall in and I'm delighted to be met by fresh cigarette smoke because it means the lady on the desk clearly won't be a rule-jockey. She says the bus driver is some wanker and hopefully Andy will sort me out. Fifty quid to the city. I'm happy to take it and get the flock out of this tourist trap. I grab a half-chicken in Centra and munch it while I wait.

Andy turns out to be an Irish citizen whose first eighteen years were spent in the People's Republic of China and the last eighteen have been in the People's Republic of Cork. He's a quality taxi driver and he hates foreigners coming over here and getting free houses. Like a lot of The Pope's Children, he got mangled by the Celtic Tiger but he recently managed to flog his apartment in Douglas and bought a family home in Kinsale in an old council estate.

Back in Sheila's hostel, beyond the usual clusters of continental students on tour, the canteen is populated by the working homeless. Fellas my age with bodies worn out from hostel-hopping between shifts. Two of them are discussing their sleeping arrangements. Here for three nights and then offski. The first lad says there's a decent hostel in Glengarriff, handy cos he's working in Castletownbere. The other lad is off to Cashel. God love him. I head into town and meet Mick O'Leary who is out having pints for his sister's birthday. They've been on it all day but it's still great to get some proper Cork bants in.

In the morning, mute Eastern European lads prep a backpack for the day and start smoking as they walk off into the pre-sunrise light, stomping their steel-capped boots down the steep hill. I get a sit-down brekkerz round the corner and watch the office workers dosing up on coffee. I cycle out to Passage West and jump in the jammer for a quick jaunt home. It has been 30 hour jolly with eight hours of driving, six hours of cycling, five hours' kip, four hours' drinking and fock all faffing. A lot of people would be delighted with this result but I haven't soaked up enough of the characters, even though I've very much felt the character of the place.
