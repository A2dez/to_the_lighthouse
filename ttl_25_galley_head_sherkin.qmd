title: "Charles Fort & Galley Head"

**0838, Thursday, April 10, 2025.**

<https://www.strava.com/activities/14139284526>

*School's out and the weather's deloosh. The sun has been blistering for donkeys, the longest patch anyone can remember in April. The calm mild air is warmer in the mind than on the flesh, making it perfect for the Paul van. Yet for now I've got gloves on and I'm thinking of lashing on a second jacket as it's Baltic in the shade and will be till the terracotta oven below warms up the overnight air. I've just plonked the jammer in Innishannon, a junction village beyond Cork City that will allow me to do a clean looparoo over two days. I'm now cycling along the steep bank of the River Bandon which I'll follow in to Kinsale and thence up to the Charles Fort lighthouse which I didn't have time for the last day. After that, I'll head west for Galley Head, hugging the coast as much as my freshly unfit legs let me. I found a cheapo bed in Leap, 20k beyond and that extra chunkeen means I'll probably have to skip the Seven Heads peninsula. Tomorrow should be a handy one though, heading to Skibbereen and Baltimore where I'll get a short ferry to Sherkin Island. I'll get the hopefully boola bus back from Skibb, before scooting home for family duties over the weekend. But I put little faith in Bog Eireann and might have to punch in an extra sixty-eight kilometres along the main road. Say your prayers for me, yeah?*

-   I've a curious allergy to Kinsale

-   Spanish seaside homes, sharp square balconies, brilliant white with dark grey trimmings, a colour scheme fit for a faceless corporation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ballinspittle

-   Virgin Mary apparition

**Timoleague**

-   As I approach Timoleague I realise it's going to be one of those silted estuary towns **whose heyday predates Shakespeare**. In fact it was the Bard's contemporaries who burnt out the abbey in YEAR\

    -   There's a yuge monastery in ruins right on the ESTUARY name

-   There's nowhere proper to eat in Timoleague, until Charlie Maddens opens for lunch tomorrow, so the benches outside Centra will have to do me, says a friendly aulwan out watering her hanging baskets. It turns out to be a blessing in the skies as I grab a quick blast of life among the lower orders in the community – kids, alcos, resting labourers, budget cyclists and the odd motorist coming up for air.

-   Two touring cyclists are settling down to lunch and auf Deutsch spraffin. I can't pin down their jacker but they seem to be in a hashtag getting to know you phase and have little interest in expanding their micro-network. But I'm jacked and glad of human presence. Yerwan is a *young thin pale soft shy slim slip of a thing*, dressed in an unlikely woolly jumper from her grandad's possibly attic, while B1xro is a *heavy trudging lurching lieabroad*, with hips the size of a cattle farmerette's, shrinkwrapped in Lycra, and his ensemble concertinas in and out with every puff of his rollie.

-   I'm trying to slip in to something more comfortable but it turns out one of my runners has bounced out of my overfull and thus unsealed backpack. As has my nice cycling jacket, my long johns and my water bottle. I believe the community use the term *ADHD tax*. God only knows where I can pick up cheapo runners by end of business in this corner of the country. Else I'll be out for dinner tonight in a pair of old, scratchy cycling shoes. I walk into the shop in my socks, knowing I need to hashtag get the protes in but I can't convince the lad at the deli to load me up goodo. The stingy prick grabs a big handful of thinly sliced egg and neatly places them along my roll before returning the remainder to the stockpile. I'm not sure if I should call the hygiene police or scold the manager.

-   The warm lady at the counter suggests I grab a basket to help me carry my many items: a skimpy baguette, a brown scone for some reason, a pear, a flavourless americahnay, a tiny OJ for the Doolittle, two litres of uisce and a birra Moretti. I plonk my basket on a picnic bench, not too near ze Germanz but not too far, and beside me is a frail, grey-haired grey-skinned smoker, old before his time, drooped over his rollator.

-   I realise my body is craving salt, as is my food, so I stall it back in for Tayto nutrition to yer wan's hilarity. On my return, a crow is trying and failing to yoink my entire baguette and my Germanophone counterparts are fending it off. It's a chance at solidarity and I manage to elicit their respective journeys off them – he's cycled here from Rosslare and she may or may not do the entire Wild Atlantic Doris – but his wide back and broad buttocks are protecting his prey so I leave them at it.

-   A big strong workman from Eastern Yoorope sits down with a mahoosive ice cream and, given the lack of ostensible emotion on his face, I feel morto for him until his even larger colleague, bald and paintspeckled, ambles over with a big-ass 99 and my emotions recombobulate as their mutual scarlification resolves into a lovely little moment. The lads lick away in harmony and are soon delighted to ogle some jailbait as her hungry bum catwalks past.

-   Next up is a procession of uniformed primary school boys, aged like ten or eleven, also here for ice creams. The aulwan teacher sits them down at the low wall afar and the lads march shopward in sixes with the youngwan teacher, dressed in woke uniform: short militaryesque jacket, rainbow lanyard and stonewashed jeans pulled up to her thruppeny bits but down only to her calves.

-   I start getting ready to face the road again, as do the other cyclists, when a sound normal curious local man starts interviewing them about their journeys. Allofasudden an aul codger comes up to me and shoves a handful of coins into my hand, orderasking me to get him a big bottle of cider inside. I oblige of course, remembering heroic teenage days when we'd drink naggins and flagons in fields after convincing grownups to purchase them for us. I come back and find him on the low wall afar and he shakes my hand and tells me he's after getting seven stables to clean out. Cash for cans it seems. He pounds out his life story in about four sentences. Martin McSomething. An alcoholic who worked all over the country in a some line of unintelligible work. The fifth youngest of twenty-one children. His birthday is next week and I have to promise to come. There'll be cans and whiskey and vodka. He'll be sixty-two and looks eighty-five about the Brendan, but it's like talking to my booze-enthused teenage self and it's time to disengage.

-   The interruption has saved me from having to be invited – or not – to cycle onwards with the other pair. Before I bounce, I get one final performance as Martin scuttles over to the tall petrol price sign and whips out his comically large Mickey before unloading a worthless dribble and gets yelled at by a nearby driver. He scampers back to his surprisingly bicycle and skidaddles off.

-   The normal local fella comes over and mansplains Martin's jacker. He also wants me to follow the coast road, as David Flanagan suggests in his gorgeous book, *Cycling in Ireland*. The Seven Heads are on the Eurovelo route but not the Wild Atlantic and I suspect locals have to nearly petition tourists onto their peninsula. But I know my legs won't have the extra twenty clicks in them later. I'm jacked after forty-five and I'm only halfway there. I cycle along the top of the peninsula, twelve dull cattlefarm kilometres to the old market town of Clonakilty.

-    and we all do a chunk of chat apiece with a sound normal curious local man

-          I grab him a big cold Bulmers bottle and hand him his change. He shakes my hand and tells me he’s after getting seven stables to clean out. He’s not into horses, it’s just a bit of work to keep the show on the road. He tells me the line of work he’s done all his life but I can’t understand a word. It must've been something awful complex. He did it all over the country. He tells me he’ll be 62 on the 18^th^ of April and invites me to his party. There’ll be cans and whiskey and vodka. A man like that might struggle to pull together a large gathering but he's the fifth youngest of twenty-one children so there might yet be a few around to celebrate

-          He’s been an awful alcoholic all his life

-          **Hang around and stuff just happens**

-          **This kind of stuff never happens in bastid restaurants where everyone clumps alone, pretending no one else is there**

Galley Head

**Alco in Timoleague**

-          He asks me if I’ll go and buy him a big bottle of cider and hands me  glut of coins. I’m thinking they might have those old 4 pint flaggons we used to buy as teenagers or, as with this poor man, ask people to buy for us in shops.

Galley Head

-   *Thankfully, on this occasion of joy, there is no need for me to witness any modern forms of compassionate discipline. I was almost subjected to it myself in work last week. I had to kick out a student for insolence and I reported it up. Instead of them just putting her straight, they wanted to arrange a supervised meeting between me and the student, as if we were both guilty. Out of instinct I agreed and then spent a sleepless night bricking it. I mentioned it to my colleague in the morning and he said it's too humiliating and I realised he was right.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Wednesday evening.**

-   School's out and the weather is good. It's been blistering for donkeys, the longest patch anyone can remember in April, and perfect for cycling with calm mild air that is warmer in the mind than on the flesh.

-   I tell Sharifa I'm hitting the road and she's pissed off to be looking after kids on her week off when she's supposed to be relaxing slash looking for a new job. But in squareness next week I'll be off work and looking after kids myself, all week

-   N25 – driving in to the sunset again, But the west might be a lot like this with magnooficent sunsets (like in Bantry slash Ballylickey)

-   I'm gonna miss Cork City and my little journeynees around the county. *Of course I can still come again lol* but it's a particularly good spot

    -   been using it as a base and it's a habit worth adopting. CHECK LIST OF HUBS (e.g. Donegal Town (yawn)

-   

-   I drive to Cork, kip in Sheila's again. My first destination is Charles Fort in Kinsale, then Galley Head a couple of peninsulas over and then Sherkin Island off Baltimore in proper West Cork. If I can, I'll get to Fastnet but that's a big one and merits its own day out.

-   I really ought to get out to Fastnet while I'm in the area but the tours don't start until Saturday. Now I could have times my trip to be here on Saturday but I don't trust the weather and I don't have the patience. Plus it's not good to squeeze in too much, like and American tourist. Likely I'll just come back

    -   Geography of West Cork, the need for a boat to get the most of it

        -   Undercutting below so no permission to go down

        -   The lads are dressed like waiters with no tables to server

-   and park the car in Innishannon this time, a junction village that connects West Cork with Kinsale to the south.

**People**

I wasn't in the Emer for Kinsale the last time, being tired, thirsty, hungry, struggling for daylight and stressed out about getting my bike out of there.

I feel lowkey bad that I'm still not interested.

It's rush hour in the drivethrough village of Innishannon. I've parked here so I can easily hit up Charles Fort Lighthouse in Kinsale (20k) then make my way west

GK is lowkey thinking of

**Innishannon**

-   kids, athletic vibe, the gear, the hurleys, the bus,

-   not the kind of people who I should ask about loading a bike onto a bog eireann bus

Aulflas

-   i'm not sure if there's more aulflas in West Cork than in other rural parts of the country but they stand out more here because they are so starkly different from the most of the people.

    -   people think it's the immigrants eroding the culture but it'sm mostly just the young people.

    -   people love to blame immigrants for coming over here and ruining the place. But the real threat is younger people EXPLAIN

        -   I once asked my dad how it feels to live in a world where everyone and everything are different from the world he grew up in. He didn't quite grasp the idea but it must be a lonely place and nowhere

        -   Maybe it's just the fact that aulflas round here have kept up the habit of loitering. Sitting on benches and walls waiting for the bantersmash. Talking weather and cattle and racehorses.

-   Demographics of Cork

    -   some stack of English accents. Could well be on holidays in Spin

    -   Hippies, random lad in Kinsale sounds like Stewart Lee's nan.

        -   In a county full of boggers,

    -   

-   I was there, *naked on a beach in Ibiza*, BUT WHAT WAS I THINKING ABOUT

**Charles Fort**

-   Dour Scot over in Kinsale visiting his aunt

-   reimagining the life of the soldiers based on the names of hte buildings.

**OPW workers**

**Iron Curtain dodgers eating ice creams**

**Twenty kids on the ball eating ice creams, with their teacher decked out in woke uniform (jeans, no ankles, short pseudo-military jacket**

**German Cyclists**

**Fella on the wall yapping,**

-          Quizzing us

-          Tells me about Martin

-          Wants me to follow the coast road and I would only I know I wont'have the legs later and I'm gutted

-          His poor peninsula didn't get the nod from the Wild Atlantic way so they locals probably have to use guerrilla tactics to recruit tourists, hounding us with niceness and yap

**Timoleague**

-   There's nowhere proper to eat in Timoleague bar the benches outside Centra but it turns out to be a blessing in the skies as I grab a quick blast of life among the lower orders in the community – kids, alcos, resting labourers, budget cyclists and the odd driver coming up for air.

Galley Head

-   71 year old lady who has lived there all her life. Never seen anything bad happen.

-   Open valley of reeds, beautiful width of space bounded by midsized riverbed, opening onto the beach

-   The landscape has changed over her life, There used to be a tunnel of water they'd play in but it's all been washed away

Ger Airbnb

-          Interesting to get a guest's view of a ramshackle Airbnb option

Bnb slash café lady

-          No hello or welcome or any pretence towards that or even like a gesture or nod in the direction of concern. Hasty departure

Sherkin Resident slash holidaymakerf

Chris & Rose & Kids

Pints in Bushe’s

**Chris Murphy O'Connor**

Chris is like *I'll see you in ten years on your next visit* but I tell him I'll be back to see the Fastnet soon and he says he'll bring me out. And to bring GK. I'm over the moon. This is exactly what I want. Connections in the boat world

I ask him how much a boat like that costs and he's maybe ten grand. Although the good new ones are forty. Basically the price of car. You might even get cheaper ones.

-   I don't actually know Chris very well, other than a handful of sessions ten to fifteen years ago, although he's good mates with Jasper and GK

-   He's like do you remember Rose and, being shite with faces, I don't at firstuntilç I hear her voice and it comes back to me.

-   The long tough winters are heavy going for a family

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Leap AM:**

-   I'm up at like half seven and don't know what to be doing with myself. Do I just hit the Dermot and squeeze in as much as possible or do I look after myself?

    -   This is literally the first time I've been in the situation.

    -   So I mosey up to Centra in the petrol station slash catholic church end of the village and sit down in one of those hallelujah corners where you can eat in peace without

    -   I still end up spending seventeen nicker on fuel, between my five euro breakfast roll, coffee, two litres of water, and two bags of scran for the road (salted cashews and chocolate raisins)

My bike is parked near the bus stop and the presence of some Yanks tells me there's a bus coming soon. I ask the driver whether I can stick my bike on later and he tells me it depends on what kind of vehicle is coming. The VB buses don't take bikes but these ones do. You can track it on *bustimes.org*. Gotta love that kinda thing. I bet there's busspotters out there, sat in their bedroom, tracking these vehicles and posting on forums about which

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The ferry to Sherkin Island is at 1030 so it's a bit of a panic getting there but my legs are strong at this hour so I drill it on the N21, scuttle through Skibbereen and leg it out to Baltimore. With a tiny bit of planning I could have had a quick look at the rowing club that has produced four Olympic medal winners ADD VIDEO OF O'DONOVAN BROTHERS INTERVIEW

-   I pass the bus stop and nip in to Dave Long's travel agency where the girl assure me me I can lob my bike on the bus later. It's a big relief cos those new Bus Eireann buses take fock all luggage

    -   good chance for a rant here:

    ```         
    -   prams, bikes, hot food, the lot

    -   no jacks either
    ```

-   The ferry is cash only so I ask the boatman if I can jump on and pay later cos I'm in a bit of a rush. He's sound about it and tells me to get cashback from the Gala shop opposite. He gives me a lift down to the TYPE OF BOAT, where a dozen tourists sit, low intensity types whose idea of a day out begins at 1030am.

-   There's a LONG CHURCH RUIN at the tiny harbour, and then a very steep ascent out. Twenty peddle strokes later I'm out of breath and turning away from the crowd towards

    Sherkin island has the sort of complex shape that could never be imagined by a novelist COMPARE WESTEROS AND THE GENIUS OF STEALING EXISTING ISLAND SHAPES. I was hoping this'd be a sheep's island but suddenly I'm literally in the middle of another blasted cattle farm and struggling to find my way. I follow the only visible road and it's made of grass. Not a road with grass down the middle of it; but ten feet of primo Irish verdure that is kept from the cattle, like a neverending cricket wicket only with a lazy groundsman.

-   çIt leads a few houses looking across Horseshoe Harbour which does exactly what is says on the tin. CF CHRIS PLONKING ANCHOR AND SWIMMING. I double back, faff about and dilly dally for donkeys. I even take the chance to call my wife and say hello. I hear noise in the shed but it's the cows who, despite their mellow nature, seldom prove to be good tour guides. Eventually I just hop the boola gate and trudge across the roughest terrain that I imagine cattle being able to manage, in my non-expert, farm-adjacent-at-best opinion. TRACTOR TRACKS AND CATTLE-BATTERED GROUND

-   I yomp on and soon approach the lighthouse from the precipitous side and I decide against climbing up to it with a massive drop below. I soon find a precious lick of clean grass and a skinny steep curving trail up to the lighthouse. It's times like these that you really appreciate the REGIMENTED work of CIL or the old BALLAST BOARD with their practice of putting in mini-Roman roads in these most isolated of places.

    The lighthouse campus is tiny, SIZE?, *a notable historical architectural ensemble*, REFER with a cleanly boarded up house fit for one and a strange cast-iron lighthouse standing out the back like an introductory dildo on a bedside locker. It reminds of the time I drunkenly kipped in Mark the Ginger Protestant's bed and, trying to reach for my phone in the morning, I grabbed his new girlfriend's toy.

-   The lighthouse lacks the girth of a stone lighthouse which are always heftier up close than you might imagine**, as we've discussed before**. The building material perhaps marks the beginning of the end of the great lighthouses, where beneficent functionality required strength and heft to fend off the elements experienced in places like this. Not far from here is a place calledRoaringwater Bay.

-   Nowadays, we've got two lights in Greystones Port, as skinny as a bus stop and as faceless as a techno DJ, squirting green and red light into the night.

-   Similarly, we have seen that same trend having occurred in modern man as our physiques have dwindled into dweebs
