**To the lighthouse III**

\
0805, Sunday January 1, 2023. 

It is, as ever, a slow start. You want to be gone but the bike says no. The back brakes are banjoed, which I can live with, and the fancy mudguard is dislodged, which I can't, cos it's dragging on the wheel. This stuff ought to be dunzoed the night before by my bike mechanic, but I am he, and here we are now. I've been tying it up to the mudguard with a phone charger but that's knackered now and so I need to dig out a longish bolt and *two* nuts to tighten it into place. Then I oil the chain and do a quick circle around the parked cars to spread the oil across the chain and the cassette, but the frikkin chain pops out of the bottom gear, and now the dérailleur is in the spokes. I'm at my wit's end with this bike. This keeps on happening when I'm climbing up hills. It did me in Chapelizard last week and it did me in Rockbrook a while back when I was testing out whether I could climb a bit of a mountain on it, partly out of curiosity, and partly to piss off all the allthegearmenthemselves who forget that the mad bastards were doing the *Tour de France* long before carbon frames were available on the bike-to-work scheme. I bumped into Alan Lewis in Terenure on my way up and he was like, you're not going up there on *that* are you, with echoes of Barry O'D giving Kilroy grief out in Enniskerry over the hack of his Virgil van, but that attitude only gave me the extra urge of defiance to make it. But the chain was having none of it and I had to abandon my climb at Mount Venus Road cos by the time I had it back on, I had to get back to pick up the chunfla from his babysitter that morning. 

#### Offski

For once I know where I'm going. Dun Laoghaire lighthouse, or at least one of them. I head straight to the N3 cos I know I'll see the low sun there, instead of it being obscured behind houses and trees on the quieter roads, and it's a, eh, Bank Holiday Sunday today so everywhere will be doubly quiet. The mudguard has already started to come loose and of course it's because I've forgotten to tighten the two nuts so I have to dismount and tighten them with my fingers just. Sunny Cabra is looking particularly good and I flirt with finding the best spot to capture its tree-lined radiance but I start getting pissed of with all the stopping so I don't bother. It's plain sailing as far as the quays from here, and I roll through Stoneybatter all the way to the James Joyce bridge on the Liffey, which really does look, at least from this angle, like the open book it is supposed to, and more tantalisingly like the inner thighs of a supine lady with splayed legs. In squareness, it was the filthy man himself who made that connection, inasmuch as I can remember John Nash telling us in college.

I turn left onto the quays and I'm disappointed that the luminescent aperture of the Liffey estuary is not bookended by sunshine, because the last time I checked (Chapter 1), there were rays of light at the end of this grey tunnel, at this hour of the morning. But that was autumn and this is deepest winter, and with the slight north-eastward tilt of the quays, the sun seems to be hiding in the Deep South. I think about turning right over O'Connell Bridge, and actually I do, but I decide against the horrors of D'Olier St and the Protestant prison because again the sun will be blocked by buildings. So I weave along the skinny, tree-lined footpath on the south quays, using my bike's might to needlessly oust a hungover pedestrian who is already struggling to negotiate a dry passage between the wall, the trees, and the puddles that form on the ruptured concrete. I'm actually surprised that town is this quiet, as you'd normally have more wandering tourists struggling to find a worthy breakfast, and few heads on the walk of shame. Maybe they were all just up extra late last night celebrating the dawn of the New, to be fair, Year.

I cross back over Butt Bridge and there's barriers everywhere cos some kind of event musta been going on last night. I saw a wodge of scaffolding th'other day when I was driving back over the East Link bridge. I actually get yapping to the foreman cos I stop and ask a lady for a loan of spanner to tighten my nuts and she gives a me a pliers in lieu. The foreman moves me outside the barriers - cos I'm in a technically work environment? -- but he's actually sound about it and he tells me that Westlife were playing, plus a few decent acts on the smaller stages. He's been working there since lunchtime yesterday and he looks shattered, although I'd say he's seen a few decent acts in his day, judging by the cut of him, or lack thereof. I give up on the pliers and give it back to your wan and I have to say it's really nice to see young women working in construction, cos you never woulda seen that in my day.

Anyways so I'm over the East Link and I do a quick bit of visual penance through Poolbeg's industrial scaldscape, before coming back out onto Sandymount Strand. I actually got this far last week, planning to hit the very same lighthouse in Dun Laoghaire, but I stopped in to see my mate whose wife had a horrific accident off the bike recently. I was worried him and the kids would be on their Tobler for Xmo but it turns out she was just home and they were able to spend it together in their new house. Thanks be to the hokey she's gonna be ok, but it's just a reminder to never undertake a bus or a lorry at a junction, until they've moved on or left ahead of you. By the time I was out of there it was too late to go to Dun Laoghaire and I ended up giving myself a tour of the Dodder River, and I'm glad cos it's much sunnier this week.

So I take the pedestrian path along the strand cos the tide is out and the walkers are on the sand, and then at the end of the footpath I hop down a few rocks to the sand, carrying my obviously bike, and thinking I'm Wout van Aert now, doing cyclo-cross. I only do a few hundred jaggedy metres on the rippled sand before coming out at Sydney Parade crossing and there's a plaque there for Merrion Strand, distinct from Sandymount Strand. I wonder if *this* is where Stephen starts his walk in the Proteus chapter of Ulysses, and it seems to the access point Oliver St John Gogarty suggests in his 1937 autobiography, where

. I have to stop again to fix the mudguard but theres sand in my literally nuts and it's hard to screw them back on. I say hello to a Saudi lady with a boxer dog, a combo I've never seen before, and later I wonder if she's an infidel like my wife, also married to an Inglesi, cos anyone with a dog like that is clearly here for the long haul.

I'm back on Rock Raid for a bit but it's Brendan, even with the advantage of a half-arsed bike line, and l'm looking for a way to get to the real bike lane. On Seafort Parade, a couple of lads direct me down through an arch and into the park, which has a bike lane, but then we all get squished through a five-foot passage between the Dort barriers and a stone wall, and it's a pedestrian right-of-way zone, and it turns out that the half-arsed bike lane award of the day goes to this Newgrange-esque passageway. I come out at the Dort Station and I'm welcomed by a modest sign saying "Blackrock: we've got it all". Except for modesty.

In fairness, the village is a model example of how to turn a linear Irish village - as in, all of them --- into a public space worth hanging out in. There's public benches alloverthegaff, and some of them are even arranged so that two or more people can have a conversation. Throw in a welt of cafes with outdoor seating, and I'd say the boozers are prone to the odd spillover too, and suddenly you have a village worth actually being in, for reasons beyond Snail Mail and picking up a pinta milk. It doesn't take a lot and there's no reason not to do more of this everywhere. Basically just keep what you had during Covid and add a few nuts and bolts for permanence. Traffic is one-way but there's a caynterflay bike lane. Plus it's worth coming for the accents alone, if only to hear how your own kids will speak in a decade or two.

I exit the village and pop down to Seapoint just to scope out the Jacques Chirac with the swimmers. There's dozens of punters here, freezing their bits off, and looking all the happier for it. I sit down for a breakfast of oranges and nut bars and feel brand new. The accents are even choicer down here cos there's an older generation with some features that didn't actually transmit down. These are people whose grandparents might have been neighbours with George Bernard Shaw, and whose uncle is mates with David Norris.

The problem now is that I'm freezing my own bits off too and I'll be stopping more at the lighthouse. I shuffle down to Dun Laoghaire, another town designed for people to enjoy living in, and I get the base of the main pier. There's a queue for coffee and signs for no cycling on the pier, so I whip out my bike lock and it's jammed. I ask the fella in Bryan's coffee for some oil and he comes back and solves the problem with some WD-40, which David O'Doherty would advise against. But it's a quickfix and now I have coffee and a locked bike. I start moseying on the wrong side of the pier walk, cos I want to see the coast before the do it up, as they no doubt will soon, given how much effort has been going into, again, making this a nice place to be. God Bless Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown county council, with their splendiferous libro and other public spaces. I get changed in a secluded spot and I"m nice and warm again as I rejoin the masses making their way to the lighthouse. I feel like this pier is a model of what is to come in the future, as population increases and more worthwhile coastal towns either spring up or expand in way that, eh, makes being there a pleasant experience.

Next bit probably needs to go

I brought the bike in to Paul on the Quays to see if he could tune it up for us. He took one look at it and asked if the chain was coming off and I said it was. He said these Pendleton bikes are just badly made but he was too busy to do it there and then. There was another lad working with him, a fella in his possibly fifties who I assume was Ukrainian, cos Paul's been kitting out donated bikes for refugees ever since the war kicked off. 

<https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/dublin-bike-shop-seeks-mechanics-to-help-with-repairs-for-ukrainians-1.4865537>

I might just have to bring it in to Halfords where I bought it in haste last Christmas for my missus, but I don't like the look of the mechanics in there, nor the looseness of the brakes when they gave it me, so maybe I'll stall over to Decathlon in Ballymun and see if Luke can sort it out, cos he's the kinda lad who can both fix a bike and help you learn more while you're at it. It's not easy to find mechanics who help you learn about the problems so you can deal with them yourself next time. Either they are too arrogant or else they want to keep you ignorant so you keep coming back. But it's my experience that the more I learn about bikes, the more I need help, cos I now have more bikes and a wider set of problems further down the system. 

Anyway, I eventually get the chain back on and the mudguard screwed in and I'm away. I can see why the pros have a whole team of mechanics and even why touring cyclists often need a back-up team. You just piss away so much good cycling time getting the bike in order.
