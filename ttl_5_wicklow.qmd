It's Martin Luthor King Day, and because I work for an American company, I'm offski for the Doris. It might be unpaid but it's well worth it, as these days are a special kind of me time you don't normally get as a 9-5 drone, because when we are off, so is everyone else. So I cycle to school with the young lad running beside me, and I'm trying to scope out how icy it is. It's only zero or one degree this morning, rising to just three degrees by midday, and I suspect that it'll be a smidge colder up the Wicklow Mountains. I'm heading to Wicklow Head today, 56k south of Dublin city, and I could buzz into town and take the flat route via Bray, or I could take the fun route over the Dublin slash Wicklow mountains. The problem is that if it's icy here, it's gonna be snowy up there.

I'm gaggo to go over the mountains because I love it up there and it's the only chance I"ll have to write about those mountains in this book. My guess is that it'll be icy on the Dublin, aka north, side of the mountains, and that once I get over the first big peak the sun will be melting any ice. But I'll have to take it very easy on the descents, which doesn't bother me cos I'm plenty scared at the best of times. You wouldn't get much mileage on the bike in Ireland if you worried about inclement weather, but safety is a different matter, and heavy winds or ice are real reasons to stay off the bike. Having said that, I have work to do, getting to this lighthouse *and* taking in the mountains, so I'm pretending to myself that it's ok. It was only afterwards that I found out there was a [status yellow ice warning](https://www.thesun.ie/news/10057298/snow-ireland-gardai-travel-warning-january-freeze-met-eireann/) overnight, with special mention of the Sally Gap, although they expected it to pass by noon.

Getting to the mountains from Blanch is a pain in the gulags and it's yet another reason why I miss being in town. From the city centre, you can warm up on your way to the mountains, take in a good climb and then roll home, all within two hours, and quicker if you're pushing it. I make my way to Chapelizard and then up the steep hill to Ballyfermot. I spent a year doing this route, between the bike and the car, lugging my son to creche in the morning. ..... a place I spent a lot of time in the last couple of years, as my son was in a really great creche there, Teanga Beo, where the kids could buzz about inside a sea of love from the staff. We used to live in Kilmainham before the landlady decided to flog the gaff and the housing crisis forced us to emigrate to Blanch where we know no one. So for twelve months I lugged him over by car or bicycle and my wife picked him up on the bus after work. It was a trek but at least we kept a little stability in his life while he was one the many children whose early years are ruptured by this country's failure to provide homes for people. We'll be moving again no doubt, once we have saved up a deposit to buy our own home, another sub-scandal in itself, and a big part of today's trip is to check out gaffs in South Wicklow which we might be able to afford.

I misjudge the diagonalization from Ballyfermot to Rathfarnham so I have to cut back across from the Walkinstown Roundabout towards Terenure and then it'll be a straight shot up to the viewing point in Killakee.

Before I start climbing I have to stop off in a chemist to get an emergency ventolin inhaler because my lungs struggle when the temperature drops this low - I'd say it's about two degrees now. The pharmacist takes forever, like a solid twenty minutes for one item. I can never understand why pharmaceutical companies can put so much ingenuity into creating miracle medicines yet no one has worked out a way to dispense tablets quickly. Surely the back of the pharmacy should just be one big vending machine, supervised by a pharmacist who can talk to the customer. Instead, they piss away their time and yours by counting beans in the back while front of house is occupied by non-specialists who either don't know anything or aren't allowed to discuss it with you.

Shorten this a lot.\
On my way, I pass the session gaff I used to live in beside the KCR junction. A couple of the lads there were in a band called Ito and they practiced in the living room and the bandmates hung around for joints and cans after. There was always an energy in the gaff and everyone was always doing something. Johnny and Steve were in the band. Imogen was a photographer. I was trying to write about the letters of the alphabet. JJ was a street performer and used to dress up as a skeleton and scare drunk people in Temple Bar. I started cycling back then, in and out of town, as we all did, cos the bus was a jake, and 5k seemed like an unbearable distance, especially on the incline home. What hasn't changed, however, is the difficulty of negotiating the traffic in the otherwise beautiful Terenure village.

After Terenure, it's the Rathfarnham and then an urban to rural continuum as the road rises slowly. Once I get under the M50 the gradient increases, 2, 3, 4, 5 per cent up to the Merry Ploughboy before cresting briefly, and it's a good chance to get a feel for where the lungs are at. To feel your first wind. I think I finally understand the concept of a second wind. When a game starts, you run round headlessly and get out of breath because you haven't yet matched the pace of the game to your fitness, but once you find your own level, then that's your second wind, an acceptable level of exertion which you can maintain. Once the road rises from the interlude valley, I need to find my second wind because it's about 3.5k at 6% from here to the turn for Johnny Fox's, with a good stint at 8-10%. It's no rampa inhumana, but it's the hill against which I can measure my lungs, my legs and my mental state. Every time I come here I have to go to the well a little bit, just to keep my legs grinding. Thinking of the late Eamonn Donoghue got me up here once, and he'd've been forty in November, God rest his young soul. My mam's illness in 2014 too. And more prosaic difficulties in my own life. Getting through the PhD and my troubles with the booze. Whatever is really wrong in my life will always come to me and suddenly I'm thinking about that other issue i have. Yet I realize that when that problem is gone, everything else in my life is now in a good place. We've got a baby on the way in a few weeks, and my wife is healthy and our son is well, and our relationship is good. My mam and dad are good and I am satisfied inside myself. Between the bike and the writing, the hole in my soul is filled, and for once I can't hear a scream, but a contented fulfilment. Nothing aches inside me and I smile ear to ear as the gradient keeps on giving. You think you are there but there's a blind bend and another steep rise, but it's all good. After the junction, the road flattens out and there's a handy 3k to go before the Killakee viewing point.

I stall the ball at Viewing Point although I don't find that it's a view which improves every time I see it. Maybe I should come here with my full-strength glasses, as my prescription shades are a notch or two weaker than my latest specs. Apart from the beautiful coast, Dublin just looks like a flat sprawl with few notable landmarks or patterns. I suppose cities are seldom designed with a bird's eye resolution, except for the likes of Brasilia, a commissioned city where the street design echoes the shape of the land.

EDIT 2 -\> Reframe that the viewing is good for understanding the lay of the land and not for specific streets etc. so the city is definde by the water and the slops, and they are not responsible for low-level deets like street layout.

I'm getting cold now with all the standing round so I push on and I hope the road is clear of ice. The first few hundred metres are through one of those dark green deserts, with unwelcome evergreen

and the evergreen trees are making everything dark. Soon they fall away and it's open space all round. The roads are clear but the grass is white with ice, the sky is California blue, and the sun is blindingly low. It's incredible. I've seen this place looking variously green and yellow or purple and red, and I've even see it burnt to a black crisp, but now it's long white streaks of ice diagonalizing out of the ground. I go round the bend and as I look back, I see the grass is all yellow. The sun has melted the ice on one side of the grass but not the other. I keep my momentum to get to the top before stopping to take some snaps, and on the descent I barely recognise where I am from how different the landscape looks, and my recognition comes from my familiarity with the bends on the road, which itself seems narrower and more cracked up than normal. There's a graveyard of trees now and each narrow stump has a plastic domino erected beside it. There's a sign saying the Sally Gap might be inaccessible in winter and there's the easy road to Enniskerry to my left, but I'm in no mood for half-arsery, nor for that fast straight descent down to the waterfall, so I punch on and I'm actually glad that there's another hill to climb now because I"m so cold that I need the hardship of climbing to warm me back up. \
\
This climb always looks less steep than it really is because it's open and roads always look steeper when there are trees or other markers to highlight the hardship, and I end up having to get off the bike at one point because it's too difficult for me. Or, more accurately, I've gone into the red because I've misjudged the difficulty. I convert this stop off into a chance to view Lough Brae, with it's steep rocky walls making it look like a big mixing bowl filled with black water. There is no one foolish enough today to brave this freezing bowl of water although I've often thought this'd be a fun place to hold a triathlon. Swim in this lake, cycle the roads and run around the gorse.

and the last time I was here there was a brave soul hardy enough to swim in this freezing bowl.

. This must be how it feels to live in a place with four distinct seasons

although from this vantage point it is easier to understand

it's not a view that improves with

It's too hard for me to yap and it's too har

The difficulty forces me to look inside myself and

If I"m with someone, it gets too difficult for me to yap

It might not be the toughest hill in the world but it's my measuring post. Like the Liffey River. Anything wider and it's a big river to me. Anything skinnier and it's small.

This means you can hit the mountains before or after work during the summer, and getting there is a

do a two-hour cycle out to the mountains, get a good climb in, and then roll home. And if it's summer time it'll be bright enough to do it before or after work.

Bad weather on the bike doesn't bother me but ice and heavy wind do because the bike just can't handle them.
