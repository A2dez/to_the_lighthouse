It's Martin Luthor KIng Day, and because I work for an American company, I"m offski for the Doris Day. it might be unpaid but it's well worth it, as these days are a special kind of me time you don't normally get as a 9-5 drone, because when we are off, so is everyone else. So I cycle to school with the young lad running beside me, and I'm trying to scope out how icy it is. It's only zero or one degree this morning, rising to just three degrees, and I suspect that it'll be a smidge colder up the Wicklow Mountains. I'm heading to Wicklow Head today, 56k south of Dublin, and I could take the flat route via Bray, or I could take the fun route over the Dublin slash Wicklow mountains.

I'm gaggo to go over them on my way to Wicklow Town because it's me-space and I want to write about it in this book because I love it there so much. My guess is that it'll be icy on the Dublin, aka north, side of the mountains, and that once I get over the first big peak the sun will be melting any ice. But I'll have to take it very easy on the descents, which doesn't bother me cos I'm plenty scared at the best of times. You wouldn't get much mileage on the bike in Ireland if you worried about inclement weather, but safety is a different matter, and heavy winds or ice are real reasons to stay off the bike. Having said that, I have work to do, getting to this lighthouse *and* taking in the mountains, so I'm pretending to myself that it's ok. It was only afterwards that I found out there was a [status yellow ice warning](https://www.thesun.ie/news/10057298/snow-ireland-gardai-travel-warning-january-freeze-met-eireann/) overnight, with special mention of the Sally Gap, although they expected it to pass by noon.

Getting to the mountains from Blanch is a pain in the gulags and it's yet another reason why I miss being in town. From the city centre, you can warm up on your way to the mountains, take in a good climb and then roll home, all within two hours, and quicker if you're pushing it. I make my way to Chapelizard and then up the steep hill to Ballyfermot, a place I spent a lot of time in the last couple of years, as my son was in a really great creche there, Teanga Beo, where the kids could buzz about inside a sea of love from the staff. We used to live in Kilmainham before the landlady decided to flog the gaff and the housing crisis forced us to emigrate to Blanch where we know no one. So for twelve months I lugged him over by car or bicycle and my wife picked him up on the bus after work. It was a trek but at least we kept a little stability in his life while he was one the many children whose early years are ruptured by this country's failure to provide homes for people. We'll be moving again no doubt, once we have saved up a deposit to buy our own home, another sub-scandal in itself, and a big part of today's trip is to check out gaffs in South Wicklow which we might be able to afford.

I misjudge the diagonalization from Ballyfermot to Rathfarnham so I have to cut back across from the Walkinstown Roundabout towards Terenure and then it'll be a straight shot up to the viewing point in Killakee.

Before I start climbing I have to stop off in a chemist to get an emergency ventolin inhaler because my lungs struggle when the temperature drops this low - I'd say it's about two degrees now -- and the pharmacist takes forever. Like a solid twenty minutes for one item. I can never understand why pharmaceutical companies can put so much ingenuity into creating miracle medicines yet no one has worked out a way to dispense tablets quickly. Surely the back of the pharmacy should just be one big vending machine, supervised by a pharmacist who can talk to the customer. Instead, they piss away their time counting beans in the back and front of house is occupied by non-specialists who either don't know anything or aren't allowed to discuss it with you.

On my way, I pass the session gaff I used to live in beside the KCR junction. A couple of the lads there were in a band called Ito and they practiced in the living room and the bandmates hung around for joints and cans after. There was always an energy in the gaff and everyone was always doing something. Johnny and Steve were in the band. Imogen was a photographer. I was trying to write about the letters of the alphabet. JJ was a street performer and used to dress up as a skeleton and scare drunk people in Temple Bar. I started cycling back then, in and out of town, as we all did, cos the bus was a jake, and 5k seemed like an unbearable distance, especially on the incline home. What hasn't changed, however, is the difficulty of negotiating the traffic in the otherwise beautiful Terenure village.

This means you can hit the mountains before or after work during the summer, and getting there is a

do a two-hour cycle out to the mountains, get a good climb in, and then roll home. And if it's summer time it'll be bright enough to do it before or after work.

Bad weather on the bike doesn't bother me but ice and heavy wind do because the bike just can't handle them.
