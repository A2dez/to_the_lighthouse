April 30, 1154

I drive to Balbriggan and find an old-school car park between the sea and the park parallel to it, full of football pitches and screaming spectators. It's the kinda car park I love. Puddles and gravel, bounded by trees. There's fellas my age, ish, getting dressed for five-a-side, and chunflas in their Sunday Football Finest, walking into battle with their studs chomping awkwardly off the hard ground, as excited as a gaggle of young wans in high heels at the start of a night out. As soon as I park up, I nip into the foliage and drain the lizard goodo. Then I whip Blue Thunder out of the boot, get myself dressed, and scope out a quick bit of kids' football. That sport breaks my heart. It used to be my favourite activity in life, to play, to watch and to read about; yet I've grown up and it hasn't, so I've had to move on.

I leave them at it and hit the Doolittle, painfully aware of this lonely path that somehow does it for me. This trip'll be a piece of piss: 20k as the commuter flies, as flat as a North Leinster pancake. The only dangers are intermittent showers and the drabness of the short Meath coast. The road is one of those horrific secondary roads, beloved of tractors and Bus Eireann, and after a few minutes I can smell rain so I stop off at a bus shelter. It'll be a few minutes before the rain comes but I know I won't get shelter on this exposed road. There are some mute Ukrainians waiting for a bus and they must be housed nearby. I see a sign for an Army Camp and perhaps they are staying they, the poor things. When the war kicked off, my Ukrainian mate Andy was off on a family holiday in Sri Lanka so when they came back g

Bike out. Train home. It really does open up your world because you can cycle twice as far and not have to deal about the misery of cycling home, knackered, on boring, familiar roads. Plus, doubling your radius quadruples the area you can cover, thanks to our old friend, *Ï€r^2^*. Throw in a bit of driving at either end and the island is your oyster. Ish. The problem is that the train says when we leave and the ticking clock spells disaster for curiosity.

Today's cycle is brought to you by Blue Thunder, my shitbox city hybrid that no one has bothered to steal off me in over ten years of cycling around Dublin.

Today's journey was an act of professionalism, a necessary result that had to be picked up along the way to completing my mission. There was little glamour in the landscape and the lighthouses were some of the ugliest structures I've ever seen, including the industrial buildings decorating the Boyne estuary as you enter Drogheda from its ugly seaside. Now don't get me wrong, I enjoyed my day out, but it'

And we could legit do with a bit of standardization in the spelling of 'town' and 'ton', cos I double checked with my Dad later on and he said it's pronounced Gorman's Town, and in squareness he was in college there in the 1950s, where the Ukrainian lady from the bus stop is staying

The bicycle situation

The bicycle situation never relents. Today I'm back on Blue Thunder, my long-standing city bike, because I haven't been arsed to fix my half-decent road bike, and I'm finally starting to accept that I actually just don't like fixing bikes, even though I want to like it, and I definitely need to like it. I keep putting my broken bikes on the long finger, saying things like I'll fix them once the house is clean. But then when I'm cleaning the gaff, I make sure go a bit deeper and move a bit of furniture and clear out a load of rubbish for the recycling, just to stretch out the clean-up job and make sure it's too late to fix the bikes. I once stayed up late to do the job and lashed on an audiobook - in between YouTube vids - and got the job done. I did feel good afterwards, but the problem is that I just don't enjoy the minutes. In recent years, I've come to understand that I'm not a builder or a fixer. I'm an explorer and a researcher, and have to deal with this tension every day in work. My core job is to build robot voices and when I'm not building them, I'm fixing bugs, and when we're not doing either of those, we have time to do more expansive projects. I'm all the time looking at anomalies and patterns, looking to find out what weird stuff is going on and how to stop it.

Each bit of discovery gives me a kick, and there'

When when I work out what the problem is, with a mix of code, imagination and a magnifying glass, I then have to build a robust computer program which can automate the process for any voice. And I never enjoy that last bit. It's really somoene else's job, cos if I'm not finding stuff out, I miss my dopamine. Building bores me and I don't get that warm fuzzy glow of the final product which I get when I fiddnd things out, or when I write. Fixing stuff is just micro-building and my favourite part is looking at the parts to see what is going on. But putting them back together is too fiddly for me. Making stuff right doesn't do it for me. Making it better does. (NOt sure about that tbh).

The next question is why I don't just go out and buy myself a good new bike. The simple answer is that we've been trying to save up to buy a house for, ooh, three years now, and so throwing money at a bike seems too lavish. Ideally, I'd be able to avail of the bike-to-work scheme, where you get a tax break for like half the price of the bike, but I've been too scared to ask work cos I'm a remote worker, and they'd have to pretend that I travel to actual work. But all I can do is ask. Meanwhile, Kilroy just reckons I don't love myself enough, and he's got a point. I've always had trouble spending money on myself, excepting holidays and booze, both of which are hashtag experiences, rather than objects. I've barely ever bought anything lavish for myself. I've got a perfectly good mid-priced phone, and an excellent work laptop. But my own laptop is an old second-hand job, and I can't remember the last time I bought an item of clothing for myself, except in TK Maxx or a charity shop. My poor wife has learnt to suffer a similar fate, and our kids have been reared on second-hand gear too, but that can come back to bite the kids so it'll be important to get them the odd bit of nice clobber. Funnily enough, paying seven grand for a Jammer never hurt so hard, but I always just see it as another form of rent, and now that we've paid off that loan, I'm thinking of maybe getting a proverbial camper van.
