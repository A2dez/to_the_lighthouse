**Greenore**

0650, Saturday May ???

I've decided to kill two birds on this trip, cos my cousin's stag is on in Carlingford all weekend, so I'm gonna cycle there, catch up with a bunch of lads I don't know, for the afterneevening, and take in a disused lighthouse in nearby Greenore, while I'm at it. There's also a couple of inaccessible lighthouses at sea, visible from land apparently, so I can tick them off today, while focussing on what is fast-becoming the *de facto* goal of this trip: seeing the entire Irish coastline. Seeing as I finished up in Drogheda last week, it makes sense to start there this week and hug the coast all the way to Dundalk, before turning right along the Cooley Peninsula towards the stag and the lighthouses. This way, I can finally find out whether County Louth merits its status as the forgotten man of the Irish coastline. Plus, I'm happy to stall along to the stag for just a few hours because I can't be on the sesh like I used to and I've long since done my nation plenty proud.

I'm up early and the day is grey. Pure dead blanket grey and poor Co Louth is gonna get it. I bring a quick coffee in the car with me, along with some crumby toast, and I drive directo to Drogheda train station, planning to park there for the Daniel Doris. It turns out that the car park has been colonised by Apcoa, and while I don't mind forking out three fiddy for a day's parking, there's somethig sinister about those pricks declaring so much land for themselves. One day, there was just a bog-standard car park here, possibly get a few bob for itself and maybe a local Mike Irmentraut, and the next day Apcoa have decided that they're starting to take money off people for it. And they do it everywhere now, simply cos they are hashtag the parking people. Where does that money go? Do they help maintain roads or reduce car-dependency. Me bollix. It's micro-colonisation. Of course, I have my own roast beef with them. They've clamped me four times in the last six months outside my own gaff cos I don't have a parking pass, cos my landlord is a con man and the gaff is actually in receivership, so no one has been paying the management fees, ad thus no parking passes from Apcoa. In the plus column, I've stopped handing over rent, and I've been keeping it *in escrow* for the receivers, so the sitch is a something of a W. Better to be looking at it than looking for it, especially as that cash can go towards the deposit for our gaff once we find somewhere tolerable to live. But I still wake up every morning and have to check if the bastards have clamped me. They average about one a month. No outsiders park there anyway so I don't know why it's such an issue, unless you count the customers to the brothel a few doors down, and they certainly don't park there overnight.

**Drogheda Wetlands**

![*The Drogheda wetlands belong more in the imagination of fantasy novelists and video game designers, than in the hearts of Irish holidaymakers.*](23_05_06_greenore/WhatsApp%20Unknown%202023-05-13%20at%2006.31.21/Drogheda%20wetlands_WhatsApp%20Image%202023-05-10%20at%2007.25.17%20(2).jpeg)

I wasn't in the humour for unearthing the hidden beauty of Drogheda Town, so I cross the main bridge and turn right onto the North side of the Boyne River, before stalling it the 7k out towards the sea, opposite where I cycled in last week from Mornington. The port is on the right, just out of town, but the tide is out and I'm struggling to work out how tidal ports operate. It must be awfully restricting for business to be confined solely to sailings at high tide, and you can imagine how frustrating the lives of the workers must be, as their tidal schedules shift by like forty-five minutes every day. We had a similar problem during Covid when my wife worked in the PCR lab, four nights on and four nights off, and her eight-day cycle looped slightly slower than our normal seven-day skedj. It was like living inside a piece of Steve Reich's phased music, where our lives only synced gloriously once every fifty-six days. Her quitting of that job saved our marriage.

The estuary is untidy and there is a handful of old stumpy stone beacons used to guide boats. While this seems odd to me, having grown up with the neatly arranged Liffey River, it's a reminder of how messy the Liffey and Tolka estuaries might have been before the docks were built and land was reclaimed around Ringsend and Fairview. The geographic similarities between Drogheda and Dublin are evidenced by their Irish names: *Droichead Atha* is the ford bridge, so I guess people must have crossed the Boyne River there and eventually built a permanent bridge. Meanwhile, *Baile Atha Cliath*, is the town of the hurdle ford, which is a series of words I always knew but never understood. It seems to be a place where you cross (a ford) mixed with a buncha bits lashed down to help you cross (a hurdle), and [this old RTE clip](https://www.rte.ie/archives/2014/0703/628268-historical-hurdleford-in-dublin-1979/) is set at the supposably bridging point on the Liffey. It's not clear to me why Dzublin became the main city on the East Coast while Drogheda didn't, and I suspect that the distance - or navigability - to the sea played a big role. This seven kilometer stretch of wetlands between the sea and Drogheda town may have been less of a help than the deeper Liffey and its shorter gap to the sea. Plus Dublin is closer to Britain, our big brother island.

![*The Drogheda Wetlands (background) draw in so few punters that locals are free to practices road bowling.*](23_05_06_greenore/WhatsApp%20Unknown%202023-05-13%20at%2006.31.21/caution_road_bowling_WhatsApp%20Image%202023-05-10%20at%2007.25.17.jpeg)

Very few people have elected to live along these wetlands, but as you hit the sea, [there is a row of south-facing houses on the left](https://www.independent.ie/life/home-garden/homes/estuary-views-near-drogheda-for-695k/31312856.html), with deep front gardens, overlooking the water, and then the village of Beltray where a Golf club has made use of the sand dunes. But the place is quiet enough that the locals must play bowls on the road, judging by the signposts.

![*Drogheda 6 - 3 Termonfeckin*](23_05_06_greenore/WhatsApp%20Unknown%202023-05-13%20at%2006.31.21/termonfeckin_WhatsApp%20Image%202023-05-10%20at%2007.25.16%20(1).jpeg)

I turn left towards Clogherhead, but en route is the in-betweeny village of Termonfeckin, whose name is its most glaring attraction. A signpost says *Tearmann Feichín* and I'm trying to work out what a *Feichín* is - maybe it's "a little view" - but when I get there I see a school called *Scoil Naomh Fheichín* and realise it must be a boring old saint, and I'm disappointed. There's actually quite a lot new houses round here so I'm guessing these people are going for the living-in-village-near-a-big-town approach. I turn towards the coast road for Clogherhead which is Louth's answer to both Howth Head and Donabate, and on my way in, I see a colony of mobile homes perched by the sea. There's a holiday park with a big shop outside it and a few units and I'm gaggo to join in the craic some time. I'm always hearing about how much fun it is to spend your summer in one of these places, being outside all the time and the kids having good clean fun all day long. I love when people live on top of each other and can't go off and hide in their little caves. When you are in a four-bed hostel room, with shared bathrooms, then you make friends fast. I've always been a front door person, sitting outside and yapping to passers-by, just waiting for craic to happen. Like an aul' fella on the wall. I don't know how people can just sit in their own garden and stare at their own walls with no chance of outside life occurring.

I get to Clogherhead village and see a couple of cyclists coming in from the other direction and I basically just follow them cos cyclists always go to the good spot. It turns out to be a cafe on the sprawling beach and I get yapping to them of course. They've come from Dundalk, after doing the *Darkness into Light* walk early in the morning, in memory of those who have taken their own lives. I think of Eamonn, who is etched in my soul, and now poor Eabha Rosenstock, whose inner zest was probably compromised by living in The Matrix, where she did not belong. I can relate. Me and Eabha might well have been better friends, but now we never will be. I eventually nudge the chat in that direction but they don't bite and the lady tells me about how beautiful County Louth is, with the sea and the mountains, and I'm glad that they've come from where I'm going cos things can only get better. I'm not 100% sure if they are a married couple, but they remind me of my parents off touring the world on their bikes, at some indeterminate middle age where you have a perfect mix of energy, time and cash to go and do exactly what you want. I ask them if it's worth checking out the cliffs on the other side of the headland and they tell me to come back on foot some day, which I will, and after that I get the head down and do some proper cycling.

![*The mild, non-Atlantic way reaches its zenith in mid-County Louth.*](23_05_06_greenore/WhatsApp%20Unknown%202023-05-13%20at%2006.31.21/louth_featureless_WhatsApp%20Image%202023-05-10%20at%2007.25.15%20(1).jpeg)

It's all been a bit stop-start thus far and sometimes my favourite part is to just cycle and forget that I've a book to write. It's 30 clicks to Blackrock, hugging the coastline, ish, and I aim to get there with an empty belly so that I can munch and listen. Almost nothing happens along this coast as there are no bays, coves, caves or cliffs. No sand dunes. No barrier islands, no muddy estuaries, no calm lagoons. No offshore skerries. No lighthouses, boats, harbours, ports or villages. It's like cycling through the fecund farmlands of Rest of Leinster, except that there's a gentle lake on one side called The Irish Sea. Detractors will note that there's an obtuse headland called Dunany Point, which I diagonalize below, cos you can't do it all and I tell myself that [no coast is viewable in its mathematical entirely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dcDuVyzb8Y). And they may point to the thumb-shaped micro-peninsula of Annagassan, but I'm digging deep.

![*The Louth flag is white, yellow and green, in that order, owing to the local farmscape.*](23_05_06_greenore/WhatsApp%20Unknown%202023-05-13%20at%2006.31.21/castlebellingham_WhatsApp%20Image%202023-05-10%20at%2007.25.11%20(6).jpeg)

I know I've emerged from deep farmland when I see a big-boned young lady on the pavement wearing undersized skinny jeans, as of course no legit bogger cares enough about fashion to get it that wrong. Blackrock is a very nice town, with boutique shops facing the rocky coast, and you can see why it recently won a Tidy Town award for Ireland's best small town. It is Dundalk's Dun Laoghaire, and I'd love to go to a cafe and listen to the people talk but I'm only 30 clicks from the stag now and I'd rather just get there asap so I can see my cousin and his crew. I see that he's online on WhatsApp so I give him a tinkle and he's sounding ok for 1030am on your own stag. The lads are going for a swim in a bit and then playing Tag Rugby at 2, so it looks like I'll go directo to them and then buzz down to Greenore Lighthouse while they're playing tag, a non-contact brand of rugby that does very little for me. Like casual dating without the sex.

So I just get a roll in a Centra and a pint of boiling soup, then I crouch outside to eat it. Opposite me is another mildly overweight cyclist but he hasn't got the memo that whenever you find someone in life doing the exact same thing as you, then you are supposed to acknowledge them. Thankfully he moves on quickly and an aulfella from presumably Munster squats down with his two Louth grandchildren licking ice creams, in spite of the dross weather. He tells me he migrated here to be near the family cos he was living in Kilkenny and the journeys were too much on him. I can see why someone would happily relocate here, being a seaside village near a big town, although he says he misses the bike cos he lives on top of a hill and isn't able for it at his age. I suggest an e-bike but he's having none of it so there's obviously more going on. It's bothering me whether he's actually from Kilkenny or legit Munster, cos Kilkenny accents can be pretty D'Unbelayvable, although I've scarcely ever been there myself. I used to lift a lot of animal feed with labourers from Goresbridge on the Carlow-Kilkenny border. My dad's shop would get big deliveries from Red Mills, and so we'd handball in a few hundred bags of animal feed every Friday, and yap away to the two lads on the lorry. The driver would always be a proper trucker, adjusted to the outside world, but the non-driver would often be a hand-to-mouth labourer, likely a boozer, often an active boozer, and seldom with the ability to accommodate their speech to outsiders. Some people just don't get it. Irvine Welsh grabs this in *Trainspotting* when a convicted Renton and Spud respond affirmatively to a judge. Renton says "Yes, your honour", while Spud mumbles "Aye". It's no surprise that Renton was the one who focked off to Amsterdam, whereas Spud was just pure Leith, even if he ended up like delivering bird seed in the probably Highlands.

![*The beautiful dark grey church in Blackrock suggests I am entering a different geological area*](23_05_06_greenore/WhatsApp%20Unknown%202023-05-13%20at%2006.31.21/blackrock_church.jpg)

\
I push on, past a beautiful church and then I bypass Dundalk because that couple in Clogherhead told me to take the main road around it. I'm surprised to find it's more pleasant than most main roads but then I turn right on to the Cooley Peninsula and suddenly I'm hit by the wind. All morning, I've had it on my back or side, but now it's driving into me and the child seat on my rear wheel is acting like a sail, as noted by the #realcyclist who pulls up beside me for a wee chuckle. We chat for a few minutes but I'm struggling to keep the pace and I tell him I'm going to have to take his wheel, so he drags me through the air for ten fairly dull kilometers. Eventually, I can take no more and I let him go, thanking him as I shoot out the back. Now you never see much when you are on the wheel of another cyclist cos your head is down and you are concentrating like mad on their movement. I've made the mistake of taking the easier path to my destination, along a main road. There's a gorse-decorated mountain to my left and I wish I was climbing over it, thinking about sugar and spice and all things nice, rather than worrying about potholes pushing you into the path of whichever scary vehicle is passing by. I completely forget about the Dundalk Lighthouse, which is barely visible from the coast and, like the ones in Mornington, it moves around on its spidery stilts. It's finally time to either push on to the Greenore Lighthouse or else take a left over the tail end of the hill to Carlingford, avoiding this miserable main road. I take option 2 because I want to catch Gish and his crew before they head off to tag. That way I can kinda meet them twice, before the Tag, then Pat Rafter, as the drinking kicks off. And with an hour's bantersmash in me, I'll have my curiosity head back on for Greenore, cos I'm learning now that there's a limit to how much you can soak up on the continuously bike.

![*Carlingford sits just south of the border, although the famous British sunshine sometimes leaks over, bringing its residents with it.*](WhatsApp%20Image%202023-07-23%20at%2008.02.06%20(2).jpeg)

Carlingford sits on the nice side of the peninsula, with the steep mountain at its back and the wide lough to the fore. Across the water are the Mourne Mountains of County Down, and clearly we are in a different geographic space now. The tourists' accents suggest that this is as more an extension of Ulster than an extremity of Leinster, and the yellow reg plates corroborate this. I decide against exploring the medieval town yet so I find the gaff where Gish and half of the lads are staying and it's great to see him, a big lump of everlasting radiance, here with his crew. He might be Ireland's most popular man, with thirty-plus people spread across two houses, and another twenty or thirty who couldn't make it. I could see even from the WhatsApp group how loved he is. The lads are fresh from a dip in the lake and nothing like as hungover as you'd expect on day 2 of a stag. It's a nice time to be meeting everyone cos they've already caught up with each other, and they are all coming and going as they get ready for the next phase of the weekend. It's nice to see a couple of Gish's closest female friends are here too, and it's the first time I've seen a heavily pregnant woman at a stag party. I lash on the kettle and sit down at the kitchen table, with Gish stood opposite, and we have a bit of date-with-an-audience, with our rugby lives being the conversational scaffold around which we bantersmash, bouncing each other's pasts off the others, and Irishly making sure everyone knows who everyone is.

Me and Gish would have spent a good bit of time together as kids, cos our mams are close, and he lived with our granny, but we drifted apart when I was a teenager and the four-year gap mattered more. Things were probably complicated by our granny having dementia and the impact that had on our mams, especially his, who had to look after her all the time. We started hanging out again as young men, when he was doing the Leaving and I was finishing college. **His skateboards and metal music seemed like bollocks to me, and I had obviously let him know, on the few times I saw him during those years.** It's only today, while we are all shooting the breeze in the kitchen, playing a rapid-fire game of Remember When, that I realise that the reason we were meeting up in the first place was that I was giving him maths grinds. Those few lessons morphed into cans and gigs and we've been close since, even if the number of contact hours have never been that high. It's a reminder of how important it is to have structured activities between indirect relatives. Without the maths grinds, we might not have had a good reason to meet up and get along. Teaching maths to my nephew and two nieces was a great way for us to spend time together, and I also worked for years with their dad, my brother-in-law, in my dad's shop. Without such structure, it can be hard to bond across ages and sub-families. The Halley family do a legendary tennis tournament every year, and the clan keep coming back.

![*Along Greenore golf course runs a tiny old train line which used to bring passengers from Dundalk and Newry to the ferry to Holyhead, although it was discontinued in the 1920s. In the background sit the Mourne Mountains in The Black North, partitioned naturally by the obscured lough.*](23_05_06_greenore/WhatsApp%20Unknown%202023-05-13%20at%2006.31.21/WhatsApp%20Image%202023-07-23%20at%2008.02.06%20(1).jpeg)

The lads all stall off to the tag rugby and I have a shower before getting back on the Paul van. The sun is out now and the landscape glistens. I follow the main road, past a beautiful golf course, where all the players seem to be women. I'm tempted to shout out some mock-sexist comments but I finally see a male golfer and I'm glad I've kept my trap shut. The golf course leads right in to Greenore, which is a purpose-built Victorian village, designed to provide a deep water alternative to the ancient harbour at Carlingford. The village is preserved in time as it has had little purpose for the last seventy or hundred years. There used to be a ferry from here to Holyhead, serving the shortest path from Ulster to England (via Leinster and Wales), but it was discontinued soon after partition, and the Irish humans building Britain must have thenceforth had to munch on Irish cattle ferried over via Belfast or Dublin. There was also a trainline to connect Greenore to Dundalk and Newry, but it too was discontinued later in the early 1950s, leaving an eighteen year old local by the name of Jimmy Magee in need of a new job. I'm curious as to how much need there was for a ferry from here to Wales, seeing Dublin already connects to Holyhead, and Belfast to Liverpool, although that is a much longer sea voyage. I'm not the first to have this question and later I learn more on an *actual* trainspotting forum where people like nothing more than to discuss the business needs behind having competing ports. The sad part from a modern viewpoint is the loss of the trains, not the ferry, and it is well known how much of a travesty it has been that Ireland used to have rail connections all over the island, whereas nowadays there are some counties without a single trainline. One of its many effects is inequality and a lack of social interaction. The rich and strong buy cars and silo themselves from the populace, while the poor and vulnerable load themselves onto winding buses. The posters tell me that local kids used to take the boola train to secondary school in Dundalk and do their homework on the way home, and you can imagine them sharing the carriages with besuited professionals and half-cut port labourers.

**ADD PHOTOS HERE**

The tick-shaped village remains immaculate and must surely be used in period films. It has the good fortune of being a cul de sac off the main road so the houses aren't subjected to filth flying off the lorries. The tea rooms survive, with a museum inside, and the lady tells me that the big 150 year anniversary was only last week, which is a shame, but it occurs to me that I might start coinciding some of these trips with local events. A barrage of cyclists arrive and I leave her to it, rather than going to the museum, so I mosey round to the other, residential street whose single line of terraced houses faces the entrance to the golf club. There also used to be a luxury hotel offering hot seawater baths, apparently, but it was sadly demolished, and this entrance to the port is now blocked off from the village.\

![*The disused lighthouse sits behind a wall, at the edge of a private industrial port.*](23_05_06_greenore/WhatsApp%20Unknown%202023-05-13%20at%2006.31.21/WhatsApp%20Image%202023-07-23%20at%2008.03.21.jpeg)

Nowadays there's a private port and a steady flow of lorries racing along the road at the excess speed of the overly familiar. The disused lighthouse sits behind a wall and I had to lift my phone overhead to get a snap of the thing. Out at sea, the view is di-sected by the elegant Haulbowline lighthouse and I'm hoping to see it better from the other side of the lough, on another trip, along with the Mourne Mountains. It's strange to see Nair Nairn from across a body of water. Normally you drive there and the only difference is the colour of the roads, plus obviously a deep sense of foreboding. The place fascinates me, being both our land and not our land, and it'll be great to soak it up from the discomfort of my bicycle.

![Nair Nairn](WhatsApp%20Image%202023-07-23%20at%2008.02.06.jpeg)

I cycle back and think of Jimmy Magee. He was one of my heroes as a kid, commentating on so many sports and co-presenting *Know Your Sport*, which me and my dad watched religiously every Monday, seeing if we could get the answers faster than the contestants. Being a commentator was one of the only jobs I wanted to do as a kid, like Michael O'Muircheartaigh or Gabriel Egan, and, as an adult, Michael Corcoran. But I've just never been able to commit my entire existence to sport. The lads have booked a pitch in Carlingford Rugby club, and I find Gish in his element on the field of play, with his dinky kicks and no-look passes. You can see how happy he is and how happy everyone is that he is happy. The tag rugby tournament is entering its latter phase and the semi-finals are about to kick off. Any noobs have been being subbed out by fellas looking to double up across teams, getting as much game time in as possible. Part of me would love to be out there playing but a stronger part just couldn't give a rashers. I'm on the sideline, kicking and passing the ball, like old times, but the urge to compete isn't there. My relationship with sports and games has changed over time, like I've outgrown them and I'm searching for something more. It's symbolic of my relationship with life in general, or at least how other people live it. While others scramble to play by the rules and have some fun while making ends meet, I am half in and half out. I've been working for the man for three years now and I've almost caught up with the gang, cos we've just been mortgage approved. The question is whether we want to commit to twenty-eight more years of working for the man so that we can live at home near family and friends, with lots more boola jobs around, or if we should just up sticks and live a cheaper life elsewhere, freeing up time to travel and write, and do the things we want. Sharifa wants to grow a garden and have some animals and have her own art studio. I just want my time back. I'm at my best when I have the freedom to explore and investigate. And I know that if i keep writing and keep doing interesting data projects, then I'll converge on the right format for expressing myself.

The tag rugby ends and we stroll back to the gaff where a hog roast has been cooking. I get yapping to the ladies serving the food and it turns out they are driving the van back to Drogheda Pat Rafterwards, so they agree to give me a lift back. This means I don't have to worry about finding a Joer or, god forbid, cycling another 25k to Dundalk train station. I hang around for a couple of hours, scranning hard with the boys, who are all spruced up now and kitted out like goons in Hawai'ian shirts, ready for the dark hours ahead. I lash on the telly to see the Lonster match and they are a couple of tries up after a few minutes and I'm relieved we won't have to bother watching the rest of it, so we leave on Sligo in the Under 21 All-Ireland or something. It's fun just catching up with Gish and his mates. We're talking double weekends as a front rower and the rebranding of Killester as Clontarf North. One lad in a foot brace tells me about the option of sea kayaking out to the inaccessible lighthouses, which is something I hadn't thought about. It turns out he's an instructor for water sports and he banjoed his leg jumping onto rocks in shallow water. That kind of carry on would bring a whole extra dimension to this project, and the idea is planted, even if no commitment has been made. I say goodbye to those around me and lob my Paul van into the back of the actual van and then I sit in the middle seat up front. I ask the ladies for a selfie with the three of us so that I can assure my wife I'm alright. We have a few laughs and they tell me about travelling all over the country and the ideas you get and the craic they have. I'm home by 10pm, early enough to put my son to bed as he has waited up to see me, and I nod off in the knowledge that I've had a very, very wholesome day.

But the big difference here is that Droichead **Atha** - the bridge of the ford - is about seven kilometres inland

Ballybough used to be an island with a leper-colony and Fairview didn't exist Presumably the docks channeled the remaining water through a narrow passage, allowing ships to come in and out of Dublin city all day long But this hasn't happened in Drogheda Possibly because the journey from town to sea is further and would require more work And the similarities lie in the Irish names Droichead **Atha** is the bridge of the f(j)ord, meaning the narrow bit where you could cross while Baile **Atha** Cliath is the town of the hurdled ford, which seems to be some kind of bridging construction

*One of his kids is in New Zealand and the other in Dublin somewhere so this spot is ticking his boxes. It's a reminder that it looks like we won't be straying too far from Dublin ourselves when we buy the gaff.*

*It's a real conundrum There's no value left in the housing market in Dublin and for our budget we are either going to be a long way out of town or else in a transitional neighbourhood*
