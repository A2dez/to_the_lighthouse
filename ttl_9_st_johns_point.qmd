title: "St John's Point"

My wife is says that this is how she wants to live. We are renting a mobile home in a field in the Dromora Hills, Co Down, and all around is green and open, with lumpy hills growing out the side of other lumps. It doesn't matter if you are inside or out, you can watch the grass grow while washing the dishes or dining al fresco. Our son can run around like a gobshite and last night I stepped out into instant peace where I could get my bike ready for this morning. She is getting to like Northern Ireland, or at least County Down, and the gentle people we've met so far. As soon as we crossed the border, she said this place was different. I told her she was talking bollocks but then I remembered that it's a different geological space up here and there's every reason for it to look different, beyond the road markings and signposts.

It's my birthday today, the big Four Oh, but I didn't have it in me to organize any parties. I've not been myself since I got home from Spain, it's been pissing rain every single day, and I haven't even once gone to the beach with the chunfla. He's pissing around our apartment with no school and little purpose. And I'm just frustrated, squirrelling away money for an expensive shite gaff, doing a well-paid job that brings me down. We're not sure if we can go on holidays while my dad recovers from his illness. I've lost the confidence to just pick up the phone and ask people to come and see me, but now that we are finally out of Dodge, I can feel my energy lifted. It's good to be out with my little family, even if it's only for a few days, and maybe when I'm forty-two I will have the answer to life, the universe and everything, and then we can all party.

The trip today is simple. I just have to descend towards the sea and turn left at some point then I'll hug the coast road along the wide bay. It's a nice downhill start, with the odd uphill lump, although I've got Google maps in my ear telling me to turn left in 800 actual feet. I'm not in the humour for its so-called short cuts, taking a buncha turns in order to save a few hundred yards slash metres. Nor do I trust my brain to process feet in real time*.* Yesterday I missed a right turn, driving up here, because I couldn't believe that 200 feet could be so little. It was one of those frightening exits they love up here on their 1980s dual-cabbageways. You have to slow down in the fast lane and then pull across two lanes and pray. When I was a kid, those roads looked so advanced, bumpless and straight, with a thick red hard shoulder, and we'd all be in awe as soon as we got through army checkpoints at the border. But now the road quality shows up the lack of progress Up North while things have steadily improved Down South.

The exit from the Dromora hills brings me to one of my favourite childhood memories, a silly valley on the road to Castlewellan, where the road goes down and then right back up again, like a BMX-ramp on roids. We used to come here because my mam's best friend (Pauline) married a farmer from nearby (Tony), and they moved up from Dublin in the mid-Sixties, just before The Troubles kicked off. Pauline and Tony also had six kids, so we each had a partner child. They'd always stall down to Dublin for New Year's Eve and stuff, with a carload of duvets and blankets. By the time I came along, we'd go on holidays to Sligo, every year, although by then it was just their younger kids and ours, jumping into the ocean waves, or stuck inside, playing Jack Changes and listening to Atlantic 252. It was only years later I found out that our gaff in Dublin had been their refuge, throughout the Seventies and Eighties, whenever things were spicy up North. But as things quietened down in the Nineties, ish, I found myself up here quite a lot, and I spent a whole week in Pauline & Tony's as a seven year old while my folks went cycling along the Danube. I remember looking across the fields and being told of IRA training camps, although I always sensed that they were the enemy, as I never heard anything about Brits or the UVF. My first memory of them was in 1994 after the Loughinisland Massacre, just a couple of miles from Pauline and Tony's, as several people were gunned down while watching Ireland beating Italy in Giants Stadium during the football World Cup.

I enter the valley near its trough, in a village called Annsborough, and there's a signpost pointing to an integrated primary school. It's astonishing that twenty-five years after the Good Friday slash Belfast Agreement, over 90% of children still go to segregated schools, so nearly everyone grows up without ever meeting anyone from the other side, until they go to uni or work. This even happened among Nordies who came Down South to Trinity, and I'll never forget Den and Simon being mates, and drunkenly hugging each other cos they'd never known anyone from the other side. Sports are also informally segregated, with Catholics playing Gaelic Football, and Protestants playing soccer or rugby, depending on social class. Of course, The South is also segregated along similar lines. This is obvious to the tiny number of remaining Protestants who often go to schools with a historically Protestant ethos, and who [can even avail of a grant towards their school fees](https://www.ireland.anglican.org/news/10006/families-encouraged-to-apply-for). But it is not at all obvious to the vast majority of Catholics who simply never meet any of these Protestants. I only noticed this cos my primary school was inter-denominational, and like 70% Prods, so it was a big shock when I want to an Catholic secondary school and no one knew about marmite.

![The downhill-uphill road into Castlewellan seemed like an outrageous undulation as a child but less so as grown up.](images/IMG_20230729_071101.jpg){fig-align="center" width="448"}

I decide I want to cycle up both hills so I turn right towards Castlewellan, away from my destination, and I stop for moment to rearrange my clothes as I'll soon be sweating. It's actually fine, no more than four or five percent, but it's a good warm up for the lungs after a few clicks of morning descent, and I make it up in the big ring without having to worry about my misaligned front derailleur. I descend back to where I came from and up the shallower side, then I follow the road for seven clicks to Clough, and I'm glad it's early on a Saturday cos it's one of those fast one-lane roads that make cycling miserable. Clough greets me with dozens of flags espressing the local identity. I'm well used to Union Jacks and Ulster flags, but these lads have several more I don't recognise, and it is extremly intimidating. I stop for photos but it's hard to capture the flags as they ruffle in the light breeze. I chicane right-left out of the down towards the coast. It's quiet roads at last and, with the hills behind me, I could be anywhere on the east of the island, bar the odd roadsigns *(Humps ahead),* or else statues of Our Lady outside any Catholic churches, marking territory. There's a small bridge over a neatly patterned river estuary and a few minutes later I notice the soil looks sandy, as though I'm at the sea, and it turns out I am, so I nip down to Tyrella Beach for a sconce at the sea.

![*Tyrella Beach with St John's Point Lighthouse in the distance (squint bang centre).*](images/IMG_20230729_080407.jpg)

The beach is long and my lighthouse destination marks the end of the bay to the left slash north. There's a fella parked on a camping chair and his hello is pure dead Ulster but his speech turns out to be Welsh and it turns out him and the wife and mother-in-law drove 40k here cos it's an accessible beach for him. It takes me two or three gambits before I realise he's properly up for the chats, so once we've smalltalked through local geography and the perils of Brexit for a Welshman going home from Nairn Iron, I throw in the rugby gambit, asking how things are in the Welsh camp, knowing that it's a shit show. Suddenly it's like listening to myself banging on about the game, only much more informed, and he's off on one now about interpretations of the law, and not just Barnesie versus Jaco Peyper, but his own reading of how the game should be played. Cos it turns out he used to be a referee before his accident, and I feel immeasurable pain for this crippled man who used to travel around Wales and England, facilitating joy. Instead, he's plonked here, while his loved ones wander the length of the beach. His regrets are not the injury - at least not out loud - but rather than he didn't start refereeing sooner, and I'm thinking I ought to get myself into it, potentially as the chunfla grows up, cos my future in the game is in those lone-ranger roles, refereeing, commentating and maybe coaching. I could yap all day to this man but I need to hit the Dermot and I leave him sat there with the wind blowing in his beard.

The rest of the cycle is pure pleasure, following the coast road along the mellow bay.

There's a field with a campsite just next door so I borrowed a wire cutters off a family nearby, half hoping our lad might get to play with the kids. I brought it back after, along with a few packs of crisps for the kids, but only the elder son is still awake, and in the morning they are gone.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

St John's Point

Getting ready

Borrowed a wire cutters off a family in the campsite nearby, possibly Travellers from the north, judging by the dad's accent (traveller) and the kids (the north).

The brakes are still a bit scoobydoobious

Downhill towards Castlewellan and Google Maps is like, "In 800feet, turn left". I can't believe these lads are still using feet. Even before we switched over, we spoke in yards not feet, so meters were easy. I don't understand feet for length, only height, and it's discombobulating.

I tell Google to Fock off cos I want to see the steep valley in Castlewellan, which actually turns out to be Annborough.

\- Get changed at the bottom, and climb up to the top.

\- I do it in the big ring cos I"m afraid to drop to the middle one, even though the gears do change when descending.

I piss it back down and then back up the easier side and I wonder how such a strange valley could occur. Maybe it is the meeting point of two mountain ranges. The edge of the Mourne Mountains on one side and Dromora Hill on the other.

This idea matches the rod

You can't cycle across from Newcastle to Ballykinler

Check the nature of the formation

\*\*\* Clough + Flags

Mournes in the background

Quiet farmland,

\- Signs for Downpatrick, where Ash are from

\- Summer of 96 in Sligo, me + Maggs and our mates Sean Farrell and Helen Shine, along with Ciaran, Tony and Pauline

\- Caitriona too old by then.

\- Pity Sharifa's not wearing Maggs's Ash t-shirt

\- Alannis Morisette, when you Fock her

Coast Road

\- Drop in to the beach

\- Welsh lad

Push on

\- Artist's gallery. Some cunts know how to live

\- Sign for lighthouse issues

\-

\- Messrs Murphy, Senior and Junior, from Killough

\- Possibly Northern Aristo leftovers, like Hamilton

Disgrace that I've not been swimming, and I've actually got my togs in my pocket.

French's of Clough

\- I've already clocked French's, and our airbnb host has even recommended it, but try to do a quick up-down through the village to see if there are any other options. There's a chunfla at the bus stop and as I'm asking him, I realize his football team, for whom he is clearly about to go and play, has Rangers in its name, plus it's red and blue. I'm raging that I don't ask him about it and get stuck in to local football chat.

\-

\- I tell the waitress that the people I know are from near Loughinisland, and she's very curious to hear who they are. I"m surprised because it is obviously a catholic village, given the tragedy that happened there

\- The next waitress starts talking to me about the All-Ireland final which is on tomorrow

\- I ask here about all the flags on the street, and why there are so many of them, and she laughs and says she doesn't know why there are so many, and I don't push it.

\- I didn't know how much Catholicking is done in Protestant areas like this, but it cannot be easy to come to work every day and look at these intimidating flags.

I don't remember The Troubles being a two-sided thing. I remember the IRA being the enemy, and there were no Brits, no Unionists, no UVF or Protestants. I still worry, when the doorbell goes in the middle of the night, that it is the IRA there to shoot me.

I didn't get a chance to talk to Pauline about it but we'll be back soon for Rock Angus and Donaghadee lighthouses, and I'll ask her then.

Pauline chats

\- More about family stuff with Caroline, and a wee bit with Ciaran (rhymes with eern). Caravanning with kids and education systems and the 11+ and whatnot.

Return leg

\- Decide to go back via the main road, so that I can admire the valley in Castlewellan

\- It means more climbing on the way home, but that's part of the fun

\- Climbs like this are harder with tired legs and I can see what they are on about when Jumbo Visma are setting a hard pace for the day so that they can try and break Pogacar on the last climb

\- Fella shouts at me I'm halfway there and I tell him he's ruining it, and he laughs, but he probably would have laughed at anything, cos that was the plan.

\- There's an acceptable level of tourism up here. It's not dripping with outsiders, like say Newcastle, but it's also not dead, and the passersby must keep the

\- I get chatting to the host's son and his sister-in-law, who is from Cavan, and she certainly seems to appreciate the beauty of the place

\- They've been running the campsite for three years. It's dead at the moment with the shite weather

\-

Caravanning in the North versus Santa Ponza.

Well worth looking up the numbers and possibly plotting it.

instantly I had mancave freedom without any sense of

You can see the views from inside the little prefabricated house, and you can step out the door and soak up the moist air

Turn left after 800 feet

Check plan and go ahead

I arrive at the bottom of a hill a hill in both direction and realise that this is exactly whatI"m looking for because Feedwell Dog Food is, or oat leas was, produced here and they used to deliver food to my dad, and I always had a soft spot for thm because they felt like they were from my other place. So I cross the road and rearrange my clothew cos I won't be needing my jumper for this segment. I'm in the big ring the whole way so it's extra tough, but I couldn't be orsed dealing with my damaged derailleur which doesn't switch back into the big ring unless i dismout and put it back into place.

I xip down and then up the other side, with a different kind of slip, and suggest that this is where these two mountain ranges meet .... I'm thinking this because on road goes to Newcastle but it's your last chance to go there becauase the next peninsula (rewrite)

Clough Flags

-   so many different ones

Landscape more familiar. Feels like sea when I realise it actually is the sea and I nip in a for a sconce at Tyrella Beach

There's a fella parked on a camping chair and i ask him some inane question about things to see on the way to the lighthouse which bookends the view

His hello is pure dead Ulster (WHAT WAS IT?), but his speech is Welsh and it turns out him andthe wife drove 40k here cos it's an accessible beach for him. And it takes me two or three stairs?? before I realise he's up for ht chats, like really up for it, and once we've done the geography and Brexit small talk, I throw in the rugby gambit, asking how things are in the Welsh camp, knowing that it's a shit show. Suddenly it's like listening to myself only much more informed and he's off on one now about interpretations of the law, and just Barnesie versus Jaco Peyper, but his own reading of how the game should be played. Cos it turns out he used to be a referee before his accident, and I feel immeasurable pain for this crippled man who used to travel around Wales and England, facilitating joy. Instead, he's plonked here, while his loved ones wander the length of the beach. His regrets are not the injury - at least not out loud - but rather than he didn't start refereeing sooner, and I'm thinking I ought to get into it myself, potentially as the chunfla grows up, cos my future in the game is in those lone-ranger roles, refereeing, commentating and maybe coaching.

I really don't have time for this cos I have to get back to the family, so I punch on.

Lighthouse Road

-   sign

-   feels like they don't want me there

Lecale lighthouses

Surprised to see the ?intro page is at CIL.ie

Coast Road

Artist's Gallery, open garden

Some cunts know how to live

Camper van at the lighthouse.

-   Think about stalling over to say hello, might even ask for a cuppa

-   Lighthouse in context?

Noah - 29-7-14

-   blubbering mess, Snot drools out of my nose as I write him a birthday card. I thinkg of Tiffer who diead at 28, and GK saying how he just didn't get to have the craic (chance?) of life. Poor little Noah only got one year at it.

-   Not sure how he died but probably an accident from the choppy water or craggy rocks

-   How does it feel to be loved? Velvets in my ear

-   I wanna know what love it. Be

-   Talk about local

As soon as we crossed the border, in the car last night, my wife said this place looked different. I told her she was talking bollocks, that's it's all one island, but the land does look different here. I remembered how the island is
