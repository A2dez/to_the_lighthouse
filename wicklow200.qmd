title: "Wicklow 200"
---

My mother has cycled across four continents and still says that the Wicklow 200 is the toughest cycle she has ever done. It prepared her goodo for cycling over the Rockies when she went across The States in ´99. She did like seven Wicklows and my dad did most of them with her, the two of them in their fifties and sixties, pseudo empty-nesters whose older kids would look after us younger ones. So I never actually saw them out there, hard at it, but it's always been in the back of my mind. Do the Wicklow 200. Cycle round the world. Write about the bantersmash.

![*With 3400m of climbing, the Wicklow 200 challenge has a similar profile to the famous Strade Bianche race in Italy, minus the gravel sections and the admittedly pro racers.*](images/clipboard-3734048745.png)

A few months ago my mate Paul said he had signed up for the Wicklow 100, along with his brother-in-law, Shane. That was the nudge I needed but I knew it had to be the 200 for me. I've slogged through a hundy k enough times, usually as part of my ongoing effort to cycle to every lighthouse in Ireland. I even cycled Mizen Head to Malin Head with my mam about ten years ago. But I never knew how big the jump would be from a hundy k to two, especially when you throw that many hills under your bike. I've only had two months of training as my shoulders were banjoed for donkeys and I couldn't cycle all winter. So I don't know if I can go the whole distance. This year's Wicklow 200 route has 3400m of elevation. and the three toughest climbs come backtobacktoback between 140 and 165k. Slieve Maan. Shay Elliott fsand the Wicklow Gap. 140k is the most I've ever done, last week with 1800m of elevation. If I do make it, I'll be on the road for ten hours, plus food stops plus carnage time. So it might be too late to even get a medal as the cut off is 630pm.

The cycle is scheduled to start at 7 but it's not a race so early birds can nip off earlier. That won't be me though. It's at least an hour's drive from my gaff in Wicklow Town to the start in West Wicklow. My alarm is set for 5 and I was supposed to be in bed by 9 but I left myself with too much to do for the day. Prepping the bike. Prepping the bike rack. Writing a fundraising page on iDonate. Dropping the kids off at the actual pool. A two-hour round trip to Tallaght for event registration. A quick visit to an old friend while I'm at it. I forgot to unwind. At 9pm I was still cooking pancakes for extra fuel on the bike. Then I couldn't find my Tony and I blew the house down looking for it. I told my wife I'd have to steal hers. Sorry love, it's on the list of essentials. Helmet. Working bike. Blower. Someone is going to need to call the mechanic. Or the ambo. It might be me. Meanwhile, my race number is "1313", so it's extra likely to be me. The kids have stolen my side of the bed so I conk out in their room at half eleven. Then at 430 I bounce out of the Margaret and monster a pint of scrambled eggs and a litre of coffee and I'm on the road at 530.

The drive to Russborough House is sixty minutes across the mountains or half a loop around them so I take the directo path via Laragh and the Wicklow Gap. I'm hoping to see what the set up is like but there is no evidence of an event. No tables for water. No traffic restrictions. I stop at the Glendalough Cafe and drop off a saddle bag of food and spare clothes, in case I get drenched in the first 65k. It's pissing in the mountains now and I'm bricking it that it'll continue. The traffic in Russborough House is fine for me, coming from Emptysville, but there's a backlog coming south from Dublin and everything is delayed. I park in a gigantic field, stewarded in with aplomb, and I go and find Paul and Shane huddling in their car, trying to keep warm. It's pretty Baltic for June. Six degrees and windy. Everyone is wearing winter gear.

*A sea of people all equal, smiles in front and behind me*

We're on the starting line at 705 but there's a delay. Traffic on the main road. Time for two bananas and a few wisecracks. At 717 we are finally released, a whole shoal of cyclists, a bunch of allthegearmen and the odd misfit with baggy this and the wrong that. This is the 100k crowd I think. My crowd if I'm honest. The best cyclists have gone already.

The first 25k is a mellow looparooney around the Blessington lakes and a chance to look at the hack of everyone. The club jerseys are full of colour but smeared with gaudy scrawlings rather like the replica pro jerseys sported by a few. Others wear clean sensible pastels from your Raphas and Van Reysels. *If it's not Gucci, I'm not wearing it.* Some sport commemorative jerseys from past escapades. The Mallorca 312. The Ring of Kerry. The Wicklow 200 itself. Some are wearing the jersey they bought yesterday at registration. That feels wrong. Many have a dark raincoat on or a windbreaker to protect them from this wintry morning.

<!-- -->

-   The road is flat for 20k, a gentle amble, a chance to get a feel for the buzz, and what the cycling style of my partners is. Shane did the Mallorca 312 last year so a hundy k is child's play to him and he's here to nurse Paul for whom today will be a healthy challenge but nothing obscene. Every Sunday he has been doing a little more and I've been out with him twice. Five weeks ago we did fifty k together to Arklow and back. Two weeks ago we did 80k, up the Sally Gap and back. He has paced his training nicely and he's well used to the climbs. It takes effort to avoid them in Wicklow.

-   The climbs haven't even started yet the terrain is still lumpy enough that it is hard to stay together. We stop and wait several times. Eventually I hop on the wheels of three lads yapping. There's far too much wind to be soaking up today and I'd rather save my energy. Eat off their plates before I eat off mine. Then a bolt from behind comes as a strongman in a sleeveless jersey starts weaving through the crowds. This is my chance. I jump on his wheel and let him drag me along. It takes effort but it just feels so good to glide along at this speed into the wind. We get yapping eventually and he's in a triathlon club in Clontarf. Delighted to be out cycling at his own pace for a change.

-   The road steepens and I lose his wheel. I'm in between now, too far ahead of Paul to wait up and I'm worried I'll miss the cut off in Laragh. You need to be out of there by 1045 and it's nearly 9am now. There's a fella in Palestine jersey and I wish him well before punching on. The ascent to the Sally Gap has begun now. Rising slowly til the kicker for the last kilometre. A long procession of bikes fills the open road and good luck to any cars coming in the other direction. I can't believe they are still open. We are going slow enough now that I can study the people's bikes. Age. Gearing. Condition. New bikes are sleek but dull-coloured. Ten year old bikes are flashy bright but lack the beauty of their forefathers. I miss my red and black 90s racer. I'm cycling Bridesy's carbon fibre bike and it's a dreamboat but it certainly doesn't belong in Bradley Wiggins *Icons* book. I'd love another gear though. My legs are burning now and I'm panting but soon I'm at the top. I'm ready for more water but there's none here that I can see. I want to take photos but I can't even find the camera on my wife's phone. I've stopped for too long before I realise it's just a habit from leisure cycles. The people I passed out are now passing me out. Lookit, it's downhill to the food stop so I'll be graaaaaaand.

-   But the wind is fierce up here and it's cold and lonely on the shallow descent. I'm reminded of my increasingly long, increasingly lonely training cycles. I see Palestine ahead and push hard to catch him. It's good to chat. *Where you from? What you on, and what's your story?* Brendan Kennedy is his name and his wife sourced him the jersey. I don't know if he's raising money but he is at least raising awareness. He's new to cycling and doing the 100k. I lose him on the faster descents approaching Glenmacnass Waterfall.

-   There's a lad in bright orange, a buzzer and a yapper. I can hear him a mile away. Just my kinda guy. He's telling me about the shelter he's getting from the lad ahead on a mountain bike who looks like a skaterboi on a paper round in the 90s. The mountainbiker goes all Matej Mohoric on our asses as lowers his saddle to help him descend faster. It turns out that my cylindrical physique pelts down nicely behind him and I've never gone so fast. Orangeman is behind and I stall on to help him bridge the gap. But somewhere along the way I overcook a corner and I lose my nerve. The lads blast on and I cool my jets down into Laragh. I grab by stowed bag from outside the Glendalough cafe and make my way to the food stop in Laragh GAA club.

-   **Training**

    -   It’s been a lonely time on the bike of late. Normally I go out for 2 or 4 hours on my own and that’s a nice break from Life, The Universe and Everything. But last week was an all-day jobbie, a 140k round trip to Decathlon, via the mountains. Off at 9am, home at 7pm with lunch and dinner in town.

    -   Too long for me and too long for my wife, at home with the kids on a Bank Holiday Monday.

-   Shane and Paul.

-   clontarf triathlong fella

-   Paul behind

-   found a fast wheel and followed

-   im also worried about the cut off time for the 200k

-   Whizzing past people, not doing the work.

-   I feel bad. I know it's wrong, I know I'm going to pay for it later, but it feels so goooood

-   Palestine Brendan Kennedy

    -   The wife sourced it for him. Great idea.

-   Sally Gap

-   ascent, people slow, pass some then they pass me. lucan fella. slow enough to analyse people's bikes etc. would love a photo

-   Stop to see if there's any water but there's not

-   THis is shocking.

-   Everyone I was with is now gone.

Everybody in the place (Let´s Go)

Similar to clubbing

yuuuge love buzz

Born Slippy.

Let's get to the nitty-gritty

There's a whopper buzz here. The tunes are bangin and the sambos are quality. I park my bike and change out of my sweatdrenched gear.

I'm caught up in the buzz.

Car might come the other direction maybe even beep us all off the road as

SITUATION WHERE SOMETHING IS ALLOWED BUT DOESNT NORMALLY HAPPEN SO THE USUAL PEOPLE IN POWER (MOTORISTS) GET ANGRY

Laragh

I email my wife with a meeting point and tell her to

I chance ringing her and it turns out she has just found my Tony, buried under the bed, back ringing now that night mode has been deactivated.

wet and cold

change of clothes in a stowed saddle bag

I now need to think of the people of Gaza

Dishing out sambos is a fella my age yet he's as lean as a raver and he's bouncing in time to the beats. Any Yokes, I ask him, and he says to wait til later. I wouldn't be the first. Poor aul Tom Simpson revved up on speed and booze, dying on Mont Ventoux during the Tour de France. The lads used to raid the Brasseries and booze away on the bike. I stall over to the water taps and put a electrolyte tab in either bottle. One per bottle said Barry O'D. I check the clock. Half 10. Another fifteen minutes and I'll miss the cut off and be condemned to the half-ass version. As I mount my bike I see Paul and Shane again, ready to leave. All the effort I put in and nothing gained. Plus I know I'm gonna suffer later. We fistbump goodbye and they toddle off for a wholesome afternoon of pub grub and Britneys.

The exit from Laragh is lonely and my lungs are weak. If I'd known I'd've gotten an inhaler in the ambo but it's too late to go back. I get asthma doing exercise in the cold. Maybe four degrees or lower. The cold and sweat musta gotten into me on the fast descent. I call my wife and she has just found my phone so I ask her to bring an inhaler. Meanwhile, back on the road.

Didn´t feel it til after Laragh

but then I´m back on it, surfing wheels like Peter Sagan with no teammates

I'm trying too hard to stay with a group of four. The last of them can't keep the wheel on the descents so I nuzzle in between him and his buddies, if they even are his buddies. Maybe they've just found each other too. We zip past three lads who look like my level, my type. UCD heads or something by the cut of them, even on the Paul Van. I should just latch on to their wheel and chillax but it feels so goooood.

I get to the corner in Glenealy where Barry O´D is stationed and he spots me late. I stop for hello, a hug and a push back on the road, and now I've lost both groups. THe fast one and the right one. Back here it's just one-off cyclists. Every man to himself. People who can't cycle in groups.

I get on a strong lad's wheel and he decides to cane it but I don't have any legs to do a turn. This is not going to go well. There's a long drag of like 3k at 1 or 2% and all the people I just passed out are now passing me out. A lady from Orwell Wheelers asks if I'm ok. Is she from Fermanagh or Poland? I must be losing it and there's only 80k gone. I can't believe how slow I am. It's mixed terrain round here, a chunk to get through before the gnarly stuff. Croghan Mountain is going to slaughter these people. I get on the wheel of her male partner but he's not a steady peddler so I'd rather suffer on my own.

Cyclists at this level – my level – don't seem to know how to work together properly. Everyone is wasting energy, cycling on their own and we are all slower than we could be. We need a grupetto of four or eight or twenty people, taking turns on the front, eating the wind while the others rest. My knowledge is from theory not practice. Watching pros going ninety. I've only been out with a club two or three times, in Sligo, seven years ago. I really need to join a gang.

I reconned this half of the route a few weeks ago so I think we're gonna be graaaand but my recon was off. We've suddenly hit a vicious knoll I never knew about. All the people who passed me are now visible up the hill, wrestling their bikes. Strongman who pulled me for 3k. The UCD-looking lads. A fella with a huge cadence but not much speed. Maybe he has it all worked out.

It's a humbling place to be. All the club people are up the road and we are back here. This is no time to think about how much stronger we all are than your average punter.

We get in to Avoca from the side I wasnt expecting and my family are waiting for me in Meeting of the Waters, which is not even on the route. I grab two quick Lucozades in Avoca, call her and tell her to meet me atop Croghan Mountain. I punch on and I'm on the wheel of three lads in club jerseys. At last. Some wheels. We blast through the base of the Woodenbridge valley – it's astonishing how easy flat roads are when you've been cycling uphill all day – and then the very long, very slow grind up Croghan Mountain begins. I know what's coming cos of how fucked I was up here the last day on my Marcel Dobler. We pass Cadence Man and I decided to let the wheel go of my group and join him. It's a disaster. The lads fly away up the hill and I'm going backwards, never to see again the people I've been getting to know for an hour. Well, I can see them but I can't get back to them. There are no accelerations left in my legs. Just steady slow grinding.

I head my wife beep about 100m from the top of Croghan Mountain and I signal to pull in at the layby. She loads me up with OJ and cheese and asks if I think it's a good idea to continue. It is. Valentine is so excited to see all the cyclists. Dudu is in shock. She's only two. It's odd to shift mood so suddenly though and I´m back on the road a few minutes later, ready to be hit by a shower that thankfully doesn't last long.

Croghan to Tinahely

very tough stretch.

I get in to the car and she gives me cheese and OJ and she's worried about my electrolytes. I'm twitching about the eyes. Although a tab a bottle is too much. Do I think it's a good idea to continue? It's lovely to sit down. The car is so warm and comfy. But now she's screaming at our son in the back and he's bawling crying the poor little thing. I'd rather suffer through a hundy clicks of climbing than listen to her anger. It's like this every time she collects me on the bike.

Back on the road is a miserable place. It's raining now. The people of my level have all pushed on and there are only two types of rider left on the road. Fellas who started late and are too fast for me. And fellas who haven't got the legs. Some of them will be getting picked up by the van soon. I listen to a few tales of woe and offer up my wheel. But they can't stay with me or they don't want to. I'm starting to notice that I'm faster than all of these people downhill or even on the flat but once the hills hit I go backwards. I never knew I was such a slow climber and I feel humbled.

A lot of people are Hankers now. I give one lad a chunk of cheese and another a slug of Lucozade. There's been a desperate lack of liquids today. There was none on top of Sally Gap and none on top of Croghan Mountain. I can't imagine the horror if it was warm. The whole section from Ballyfad to Tinahely is punishing but I have to tell myself that the endgoal is 125k and not 200k. Just get to the next stop.

Tinahely 125k

Tinahely - Slieve Maan

Dizzy new heights

I knew that the 20k from Tinahely to Slieve Maan would be harder than it looked on the profile but I never knew how wrecked I was going to be.

By now everyone is at their own pace and no groups remain. The club people are gone so its just one-off punters surviving. I cannot believe how slowly we are going but by know I have been beaten up enough to know that this is all I've got. One power output. Very slow and fairly steady. I´m piss quick on the descents though and I can catch up with others. My weight is an advantage

Friday Drunk.

Saturday steady

Sunday slow slow slow

Near Slieve Maan, I get yapping to one of two lads in their fifties. Country accents. But then I lose one wheel and the other lads vaults ahead to his mate. There are no accelerations left in my legs

Weak become heroes (The Streets / Mike Skinner)

The climb up Slieve Mann is a scene I will never forget. A dozen or five cyclists are scattered up the open road

The weak become heroes, then the stars align

Slieve Maan from Aghavannagh

Slieve Mann (40bpm Funereal Mix)

Slieve Mann (40bpm Mourning After Mix)

About a kilometre before Slieve Mann, I hear someone is on my wheel and I’m delighted to have company at long last as I start the ascent. Little do I realise how slow and sombre the ordeal will be. How spiritual. How intimate. How memorable.

Slieve Mann is hedgeless and open, making the road look flatter than the 12% ramp which has just smashed into us. Up ahead is a scattered procession of wobblers. Twenty or fifty of them, I can’t count. Near in space, far in time. My legs are burning and I'm panting llike a dog but my head is clear enough to drink in the horror of the task. The wheel behind me grinds a yard ahead, the final member of the Latin cycling club, dressed in angelic white, a tiny body on a tiny bike, cycling so slowly and serenely that I can only surrender to her rhythm. Cycling backwards, just ahead, is the elder of the two country lads, God-like now with his grey beard and long grey hair, close enough to touch. His pacing is less steady. There are three of us now, together, like kids running through the meadow, holding almost hands. Like mourners at a funeral. Silent. Sombre. Proceeding. I tell God it’s like a slow bicycle race but he shushes me. Time for work, he says. The whole mountain is ecclesiastical in its silence, as if none of us were here. The funereal procession continues. Time has stopped. Head down. Eyes no further than the wheel ahead. Matching rhythms. As intimate as intercourse. As brutal as rugby. As pensive as a long walk. But no one else can carry your cross on this gradient. No teammate, no partner, no other force. Only you can push onwards and upwards. So slow that the downstroke is a different beat to the upstroke. Kadunk, kadunk, kadunk, kadunk, kadunk, kadunk, kadunk. Someone smoothly glides past us. We pass someone. I whisper well done into a lad’s ear and he whispers back. Make sure to eat and drink I say to my companion. Here's a glucose tab.

We stop at the top. A water station at last. A man with a van and a tank of juice. I feel elated. We know we'll make it now. We descend to Glenmalure and then it's the Shay Elliott climb. I'm expecting something short and sharp, so I ask the stewards. What's this, 2k? And then some, they laugh. But it doesn't matter. I could climb forever now. My companion has taught me patience. She says she listens to her breathing in order to pace herself although she's also had to listen to me panting like a dog. I lose her wheel after a kilometre or so then a further up the hill she is pulled over on the side of the road, eating, starving, bonking. I offer to stop but she says it's ok so I plough on and feel guilty. There's a few familiar jerseys loitering at the top but I miss the monument dedicated to Shay Elliott, the trailblazing Irish cyclist who twice wore the yellow jersey in the Tour de France, the first English speaker to wear it. I have to stop briefly on the descent to Laragh and my companion joins back up so we finally have a chance to yap on the road. Hi, how are you? I'm the stranger who just spent the most intense hour of my life with you.

In Laragh she catches up with her gang and I yap to a few heads I've been seeing on the road. The UCD lads, which they're not. A father-daughter combo. Everyone's on Cloud Nine. 35k to go. We'll be graaaaand. My belly is in a jocker now so I put a sambo in my pocket and plan to gnaw away at it on the road. I head off with Dave from Limerick but the climb splits us and I'm back on my Tobler up the Wicklow Gap. 6k, 4%. Long, slow, steady. I only have one pace now anyway. Head down, follow through. I reconned this climb eight days ago so I know what's coming from below. Rain falls from above, wind blows from the front and there's cold all around me. But I don't care now. At the top I meet your wan again as her friends have dropped her on the climb, so we ride home together. A freezing descent and then mellow 20k jaunt that feels like nothing. My back is a bit sore but nothing major. Lord knows how I'll be in the morning. She wants to race the last few hundred metres but I only last fifty. Her gang are there to cheer her on but Russborough House has been mostly abandoned. The food is gone. The photographers are gone. The fields of cars are gone. Thankfully the man with the medals is still dishing them out. Is anyone else out there he asks. A few I say and he huffs. It's nineteen thirty now and he's probably done a fourteen hour shift. I thank him for staying. I've never been so proud of myself.

I offer my companion and her friend a lift to their accommodation in Valleymount. They were planning on cycling another 11k to get there. I load my car with bikes and sodden cyclists. Isabel and Sarideth. Life is returning to normal. Cyclists have names and lives. I'm up at 7 to get the kids ready then I'm in work. The girls are off work tomorrow and I see on Strava that they've cycled home to Dublin. I already wish I was back on my bike. Someone asks me if I'd ever do the Wicklow 200 again. I tell them I'd do it next week if I could. I just love the misery.

Isabel and her friend, Sarideth, need a lift to their B'n'B in Valleymount. They were planning on cycling another 11k.

My mother has cycled across four continents and still says that the Wicklow 200 is the toughest cycle she has ever done. It prepared her goodo for cycling over the Rockies when she went across The States in ´99. She did seven Wicklow200s and my dad did most of them with her, so doing it has been in the back of my mind since I was a chunfla. Today’s cycle is up and down all day. 3,300m of elevation over 200 clicks.

The first 20k is a flat warm up, with a looparooney round the Blessington lakes before climbing 20k up to the Sally Gap, slow and steady til the last bit.

Training

It’s been a lonely time on the bike of late. Normally I go out for 2 or 4 hours on my own and that’s a nice break from Life, The Universe and Everything. But last week was an all-day jobbie, a 140k round trip to Decathlon, via the mountains. Off at 9am, home at 7pm with lunch and dinner in town.

 Too long for me and too long for my wife, at home with the kids on a Bank Holiday Monday.

I don’t sleep til 1am cos I’m wired and I have my alarm set for 7.  I wake up at like half seven, plonk the kids in the car and lob a slice of toast at them. On the way to school, my son says, Daddy, when I grow up I want to do a cycle like that too.

It’s the busiest week of the year in work. Waddaya gonna do? I

A breakthrough cycle

She did it seven times during the 90s and my dad did

and my dad did it seven times in the 90s during they cycling heyday

She did it seven times, usually with my dad who became her main cycling partner for ten years, during their 50s and 60s. Taking on the challenge has been on my mind

-          I didn’t know that it would be so difficult to make the jump from 100k to 200k, at least when climbing. I had never even cycled 100 miles before and yet on their trips across the world, they’d do that every day, six days a week, for two or four or even seven weeks when they went across Australia.

The climb up Slieve Mann is a scene I will never forget. A dozen or five cyclists are scattered up the open road

Slieve Mann (40bpm Funereal Mix)

Time has stopped Head down. Eyes no further than the wheel ahead. Matching rhythms. As intimate as intercourse. As brutal as rugby. As surreal as mourning in unison. But no one else can do it for you. No teammate, no partner, no other force can carry your cross. Only you can push on. Kadunk, kadunk, kadunk, kadunk, kadunk, kadunk, kadunk. Someone glides past us. We pass someone. I whisper well done into one lad’s ear and he whispers back. The climb flattens a tad and I manage a sneaky photo of God and the granite ridge beyond.

One k or so before I get to

The toughest climbs are backloaded for extra lolz with Slieve Maan and Shay Elliot coming back to back after 140k, and the shallower Wicklow Gap soon after. 140k is the most I've even cycled, six days ago, and I was destroyed afterwards.

Today’s route is up and down all day with 3,400m of elevation. In pro racing, that'd be 80% of Liege-Bastogne-Liege (one of the top five one-day races or Monuments)

which Sean Kelly won twice in the 80s and Dan Martin won in 2013.

or all of Strade Bianche minus the gravel (the one that wants to become the sixth Monument).

Stopping to see my family was a mistake. My wife says I´m twitching. Lack of electrolytes. I feel like staying in the car. I genuinely cannot believe I have to cycle another hundred kilometres. I tell her I'll give her a bell in case I need to get off in Glendalough.

I did far too much yesterday. I was up at 7am writing a fundraising page and by 9pm I was still cooking pancakes for the road today. Then I misplaced my phone and blew the house down looking for it. I told my wife I'd have to steal hers for the day. It's on the list of essentials. Helmet. Essential. Working bike. Essential. Phone. Essential. Someone is going to need a mechanic or an ambo. And I've been given number 1313, so there's double the odds it'll be me.

Last night was a shambles. First off I did too much in the day. I was up a half six or whatever and blasted out a charity page that may have since vanished. That took my to 930 at which point the kids were in a jocker and starving, so I made a few pancakes, legged it to swimming and then came home and spent like ninety minutes getting the bike in order and loaded on the car, ready to do a dummy run. I have to drive to Tallaght by 3pm to register for the frikkin event so me and the chunfla are on se depeche mode at 2, a tight squeeze with the inevitable traffic on the M-Fifto. Cycle Superstore is a buzz. I've never been to such a big bike shop and I grab a loada goodies for the morrow. Gels, bars, a bottle. Kid in a sweetshop kinda thing. Yer wan at registration tries to flog me a Wicklow 200 jersey, and frankly I want to buy one, but I'm not jinxing myself by buying clothes before the baby is born. My race number is 1313 and enough bad luck for one day. Having said that, as a numbers and curiosities man myself, I'm very excited about pinning on my numbers upside down, and showing off my cycling knowlz.

Me and the chunfla grab nosebag in the Old Mill although Lonster have already destroyed Glasgow agin we arrive so the very long wait is interminable. We pop in to an old friend of mine in Knocklyon so it's after 7 when we get home. In theory that's good but I'm a bundle of excess energy. Pure nerves. I haven't cycled all week. I haven't felt like this since they day we emigrated to America and I was bricking it that The Yanks wouldn't let me on the plane. Im there making the rest of the pancakes for the cycle in the morning, not unwinding, and before I know it I can't find my Tony Blair. I hate looking for things. I just go about my business until it shows up but it's bedtime now and I'm offski at 5am so I have no business to go about. Instead I blow the house down, piss everyone off, tell me wife I have to take her Tony tomorrow and get to sleep after 11 bells. I'm up at half four, which is a good thing cos my quick breakfast takes longer than I want it to.

I don’t sleep til 1am cos I’m wired and I have my alarm set for 7.  I wake up at like half seven, plonk the kids in the car and lob a slice of toast at them. On the way to school, my son says, Daddy, when I grow up I want to do a cycle like that too. f

Drive over

The drive from Wicklow Town to Blessington is sixty minutes across the mountains or half a loop around them so I take the directo path via Laragh and the Wicklow Gap. I'm hoping to see what the set up is like for thousands of people to pass through but you wouldn't know anything is going on. I stop at the Glendalough Cafe and drop off a saddle bag of food and spare gear, in case I get drenched in the first 65k. The traffic in Russborough House is fine for me, coming from nowheresville, but there's a backlog coming from Dublin and everything is delayed.

I park in a gigantic field, stewarded in with aplomb, and I find Paul and his brother-in-law, Shane, huddling in the car and tyring to keep warm. It's pretty Baltic for June. Six degrees and windy. Everyone is wearing winter gear.

I suggest we hit the proverbial. Its 715 now and the 200 crowd are probably gone. I feellike I'm already up against it and suddenly there's a backlog, waiting for the traffic to pass on the main road.

a few hundred of us lined up in a

Kick off is from 7am and the cut off time is 630pm so I don't even know if I'll get a medal after that time.

Then I have to set up my Strava on her phone. If it's not on Strava then it didn't happen.

**All I have to do now is attach my race number to my bike. Upside down. That's the tradition if you get number 13 and I've gotten it twice. Of course I banjax it and waste my cable ties**
